This is due to its inaccessible\nposition, the warlike and ungovernable qualities of\nits numerous tribes, and the enormous difficulty of\nholding in check, when subdued, the inhabitants of\nso vast an expanse of territory. There is no part\nof the world more stained with blood and oppression\nthan the Soudan; no country where the worst\npassions of cruel races have had a freer vent, or\nwhere lawlessness has been more rife, or slavery\nmore brutally practised.\nOf the early history of the Soudan, designated by\nthe ancients under the general term of Ethiopia,\nlittle is known, save of a few expeditions sent by\nrulers of Egypt to explore and conquer the regions\nof the Upper Nile. The first expedition history\ntells of is one sent by Amenhotep, King of Egypt,\nB.C. 1500. Rameses invaded Ethiopia; Cambyses,\nthe Persian conqueror of Egypt, marched his\nvictorious army into that country, only to be de-\nstroyed; and numerous expeditions of a like nature\nwere made by the succeeding rulers of Egypt, with\nvarying success.\nIn 24 A.D. an invasion-contrary to all precedent\n-was made by the Ethiopians, under Candace,\nQueen of Merawi, into Egypt; but, after a fierce\nbattle at Elephantine, they were defeated by the\nRomans under Petronius. Merawi at this time was\nthe principal city in Ethiopia, and, according to\nsome writers, was mightier than the far-famed\n"

They\nwere out-numbered, however, and the whole of\nUpper Nubia was overrun with tribes of wandering\nArabs, who had embraced the Koran, and now set\nthemselves up as governors after all but exterminat-\ning the inhabitants.\nThe year 1821 A.D. is an important one in the\nhistory of the Soudan. MAHOMED ALI, Khedive of\nEgypt, despatched an expedition up the Nile under\nB 2\n"
"4\nPART I\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nhis son Ismail, and the provinces of Dongola\n(hitherto a separate kingdom), Kordofan and Sennâr\nwere conquered and annexed. KHARTOUM 1 was\nfounded and made their capital. Military stations\nwere established on the Blue and White Niles, and\nthe provinces were, as far as possible, brought under\nthe rule of the Egyptians.\nThe only result of\nMahomed's conquest was to make Khartoum the\ngreat central slave-mart of the Soudan, though of\ncourse the trade itself had been long established.\nDuring the rule of Abbas, Mahomed's grandson,\nwho ruled Egypt from 1848 till 1854, the Soudan\nwas in a deplorable condition. Abbas was succeeded\nby Said Pasha, who will always be honourably re-\nmembered in connection with the Soudan, as being\nthe first Egyptian monarch who made any active\nattempt to suppress the slave-trade; but his efforts\nwere futile, for he was powerless to enforce his wishes.\nAlthough the country had been annexed and military\ngarrisons had been established, the Arab tribes had\nnever been subjected to any form of rule or govern-\nment, and all that could possibly be expected of\nthem was payment of some tribute of varying\namount.\nIn 1861 when SIR SAMUEL BAKER visited the\nSoudan-then governed by Musa Pasha-he found\nit in the same lamentable condition. In 1869 he\nwas appointed Governor-General of the Equatorial\n1 \"Khartoum\" means an \"elephant's trunk,\" and was probably\nmeant to describe the narrow neck of land between the White and\nBlue Niles, on which the city stood.\n"
"CHAP. I\n5\nEARLY HISTORY OF THE SOUDAN\nProvinces, with control of the country south of\nGondokoro. The administration by the Egyptian\npashas-who had made a practice of leasing large\nterritories to traders who used them for slave-dealing\npurposes-had reduced the wretched inhabitants to\nthe lowest ebb of misery. Sir Samuel Baker made\nvigorous efforts to put down this execrable traffic,\nby which whole countries and districts in Equatorial\nAfrica had been depopulated, and he succeeded in\ndealing heavy blows to the trade. Had he obtained\nany assistance from the corrupt Egyptian officials,\nKhartoum as a slave-mart would have ceased to\nexist.\nBaker returned to Cairo in 1873, and was\nsucceeded the following year by Charles GORDON,\na colonel in the Royal Engineers, whose name has\nbecome inseverably connected with the history of\nthe Soudan.\nGordon regarded the suppression of the slave-\ntrade as the highest of the duties entrusted to\nhim. The policy was adopted of bringing all the\nSoudanese provinces under a firm rule, and in 1874\nDarfur and Harar were annexed to Egypt. This\npolicy was absolutely necessary if any successful\neffort was to be taken against the slave-dealers.\nSome of the latter, who paid rent to the Egyptian\nGovernment, were immensely wealthy and powerful,\nand assumed absolute control over large territories.\nThe most notorious of these was ZOBEIR Pasha, who\nlived in princely style, exercised great influence in\nthe Soudan, and practically controlled the slave-\n:\n"
"6\nPART I\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\ntrade. Zobeir's position may be cited as an instance\nof Gordon's difficulties with the Egyptian Govern-\nment. Gordon had insisted that the destruction of\nZobeir's gang was the turning-point in the slave-\ntrade question, yet the Cairene officials not only\nignored this fact, but created Zobeir a pasha, and\ntreated him as an honoured guest, whilst Nubar\nPasha (the Egyptian Minister) even offered to send\nZobeir to assist Gordon in the suppression of the\ntrade. He evidently believed in \"setting a thief to\ncatch a thief!\"\nOn the 4th of August, 1877, a Convention was\nconcluded between Great Britain and Egypt, by\nwhich all public traffic in slaves was prohibited ;\nwhilst private trade in Egypt was to be suppressed\nin 1884, and in the Soudan in 1889. Referring to\nthis, Gordon wrote: \"If the liberation of slaves\ntakes place in 1884, and the present Goverment\ngoes on, there cannot fail to be a revolt of the\nwhole of the country. It is rather amusing to\nthink that the people of Cairo are quite oblivious\nthat in 1884 their revenue will fall one-half.\nSeven-eighths of the population of the Soudan are\nslaves, and the loss of revenue in 1889 will be more\nthan two-thirds.\"\n.\nGordon was assisted by an Italian named GESSI,\nGovernor-General of the Bahr-el-Ghazal; 1 and in\none year (March, 1878, to March, 1879) they\n1 Gessi died in 1881, and was succeeded in the Bahr-el-Ghazal by\nLupton Bey. Lupton had been a mate in the P. and O. Company's\nservice. He became a prisoner on the fall of the Soudan, and died\nat Khartoum in 1891.\n"
"CHAP. 1 EARLY HISTORY OF THE SOUDAN\n7\n-\n-\nsucceeded in capturing sixty-three caravans of\nslaves. Needless to say their efforts were resisted\nin every way by the slave-dealers, and in June,\n1878, a revolt, instigated by Zobeir, and led by his\nson Suleiman, broke out. The principal slave-\ndealers had apportioned out, among themselves, the\nprovinces of the Soudan, and they gave out that\nthey would not stop short of Cairo. They were\nsupported by Arab tribes, and seemed powerful\nenough to tax the strength of all Egypt. This\ninsurrection was suppressed by the bravery and\nenergy of Gessi. Suleiman was shot, with eleven\nother ringleaders, in July, 1880.\nGordon's experiences would fill many volumes,\nand contain the most astounding revelations of\ncruelty and barbarity it is possible to conceive. He\ncertainly broke the back of the slave-traffic, and if\nthere had been any really honest intention to assist\nhim on the part of the Egyptian pashas, his efforts\nwould have put an end to it. On his departure in\n1879, and the reassumption of government by the\nEgyptians, the trade revived with remarkable\nactivity, and the familiar crack of the slaver's whip\nresounded throughout the length and breadth of the\nSoudan.\nWe are now brought to a most important period\nof this history, namely, the rise of the Mahdi.\nThat the inhabitants of the Egyptian provinces of\nthe Soudan would sooner or later rise in a body\nand fall upon their oppressors, was only to be\nexpected; but no one could foresee a rebellion so\n:\n:\n"
"8\nPART I\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nrapid in its growth, so fanatical in its nature, and so\nfar-reaching in its consequences, as that which was\nnow to take place.\nThe misery and poverty of the inhabitants, the\nvenality and oppression of the Egyptian tax-\ncollectors, and, above all, the discontent of the\nBaggara tribe--the great slave-traders of the\ndesert-rendered the Soudan in a condition ripe\nfor open rebellion, wanting only some leader to\nappear who could unite all the forces under one\nflag. The Mahdi was that person, and his banner\nwas that of Islam, ever a subject of overwhelming\ninfluence with the fanatical Arabs.¹1\n1 It is interesting to note the extent of the Egyptian Soudan at the\ntime it fell into the hands of the Mahdi. It comprised: Lower Nubia\n(between Assouan and Dongola), Upper Nubia, which included Dongola,\nBerber, Shendy, Halfyieh (Khartoum), Sennâr (on Blue Nile) and\nother districts; Kordofan (El Obeid), Darfur, the Equatorial provinces\nof Lado, Bahr-el-Ghazal, &c.; the Suakin districts, and Harar and\nGalla (now provinces of Abyssinia).\nThi\n"

Whether his life at that time was\nreputable or not we cannot say, but we know that\nhis subsequent career was marked by a continuous\ncourse of sensuality. He fulfilled every condition\nnecessary for a successful leader. To all who\nhad grievances he promised reform; he preached\nuniversality in religion and law, and equality of\ngoods.

On the 9th\nof December, 1881 Rashed Bey was defeated by\nthe Mahdi, and he and 1,400 men were killed.\nOn the 7th of June, 1882 a force of 4000 Egyptians\nunder Yussef Pasha, was surprised and massacred\nat Mesat, near Jebel Gedir, which disaster placed\nthe whole of Southern Kordofan in the Mahdi's\nhands.

On\nthe 9th of September Hicks started from Omdur-\nman with 11,000 \"weeping soldiers\"-many of\nwhom had been brought to the seat of war in\nchains!-and 6,000 camels and horses. They met\nwith no opposition until they reached Kashgal, near\nEl Obeid, in Kordofan. Here the Mahdi had\ncollected a force of 40,000 fighting men, and on the\nIst of November the two opposing forces encountered\neach other. For four days Hicks maintained an\nunequal struggle, but on the 5th of November a\ntreacherous guide led the Egyptians into a wood in\nwhich the Mahdists were secreted. The latter\nswept down, with fanatical fury, on the ill-fated\nEgyptians, who, offering little or no resistance,\nwere massacred in a little over a quarter of an\nhour, only some three hundred effecting their escape.\nHicks was the last of the European officers to fall,\nafter making a most heroic and desperate resistance.\nTwelve hundred native officers were killed, includ-\ning Alla-ed-deen Pasha (Governor-General of the\nSoudan); so too was Mr. O'Donovan (Daily News\ncorrespondent). Thirty-six Krupp, Nordenfelt, and\nmountain guns were captured, and all the ammuni-\ntion and baggage animals. This signal victory\nplaced the Soudan at the feet of the Mahdi, and\nColonel Coetlogon, at Khartoum, at once put that\ntown in a state of defence.\nThe day following the disaster to Hicks, another\nreverse befell the Egyptian arms in the Eastern\nSoudan.

On the 6th of\nNovember (1883) a force sent to relieve Tokar was\ncut to pieces by Osman's troops, and Captain Mon-\ncrieff, the English Consul at Suakin, was killed. In\nDecember a similar attempt to relieve Sinkat resulted\nin 760 out of 800 of the relieving force being\nmassacred.\nThe main anxiety of the Egyptians, acting under\nthe influence of the British Government, was now\nfor the safety of the Red Sea Littoral, and pre-\nparations were made accordingly. The Egyptian\narmy which Sir Evelyn Wood had created, had\nbeen raised on the understanding that they would\nbe exempt from service in the Soudan.

Gordon was to do what he could to\nrestore order, and, if possible, was to set up a\nnative government in Khartoum, where the civil\nEuropean and Egyptian population amounted to\nover 11,000 souls. Gordon assented to these\nproposals, on the condition that he went out under\nthe ægis of the British Government.

On the 20th of March\nthe Mahdists began firing into Khartoum. In May\nBerber fell into the hands of the Mahdists, and\nDebbeh was the last station to which the telegraph\nextended. Thus whilst British troops were em-\nbarking for home from Suakin, garrison after gar-\nrison in the recesses of the desert was being put to\nthe sword, Khartoum was being closely invested,\nand Gordon, in spite of his repeated messages, was\nleft, with Colonel Stewart and Mr. Power, to hold out\nas best he could. Gordon's hopeless position was\nbeginning to be fully recognised by the majority of\nthe English people, but the Liberal Government of\nMr. Gladstone felt unequal to the task. Public\nfeeling, however, ran so high that the Government,\nfinding further procrastination useless, decided to\nmake an effort to save the man they had sent out.\nIn August, 1884, an expedition for the relief of\nGordon was decided upon.\nAt the end of October, in the same year, Omdur-\nman was besieged by a force sent by the Mahdi,\nand communication with Khartoum, on the opposite\nbank of the Nile, was cut off. When Gordon\ndiscovered this by signal, he sent a force for its\nrelief, and a furious battle, in which the rebels lost\nheavily, was fought on the 12th of November.\nThe rebels, however, still retained their position\nround Omdurman, made forts between it and\n"

Poor Gordon,\ndeserted by his country, was in despair, for the\npeople no longer believed that\nBritish force\nwas coming to their assistance; the anxiety he\nhad undergone had gradually turned his hair to\na snowy white. The garrison was reduced to the\nlast straits, his people were perishing from disease\nand famine, the grip of the enemy was tightening, and\ndesertions to the Mahdi were of daily occurrence.\na\nThe NILE CAMPAIGN of 1884-5, and the\nheroic efforts of the British troops in the dash\nfor Khartoum, is still in the public memory, and\nwe will only give a brief sketch of it here.

On the\n14th of December he wrote on a piece of paper\nno larger than a postage stamp : \"Khartoum all\nright.-C. G. GORDON.

The \"Desert Column\" pushed on\nnext day towards Metemmeh, where they hoped\nto open communication with Gordon's steamers.\nOn the following day (the 19th of January) they\nwere attacked at GUBAT, General Stewart was\nmortally wounded, and Sir Charles Wilson took\ncommand. The Arabs tried their same mad\nrushes, but the men preserved a firm formation,\nand prevented them from ever reaching the square.\nMetemmeh was found to be in the possession of\nthe enemy, but no attack was made upon it. On\nreaching the river, Wilson was joined by four of\nGordon's steamers, which had come down from\nKhartoum and brought despatches from Gordon.\nOne, dated the 14th of December, said: “I have\ndone all in my power to hold out, but I own I\nconsider the position extremely critical, almost\ndesperate, and I say this without any feeling of\nbitterness with respect to her Majesty's Govern-\n1 Our loss was 9 officers (including Colonel Fred Burnaby) and 65\nmen killed, and 85 wounded.

On the\n31st of December he advanced with 6,000 Arabs\non GINNISS, where the Frontier Field Force, con-\nsisting of the British under General Stephenson\nand the Egyptians under their Sirdar Grenfell,\nawaited them. The Egyptian army was only in\nthe second year of its existence, but acquitted itself\nadmirably; and a decisive blow was inflicted on\nthe enemy, who lost over 600 killed and wounded.\nThe losses on our side were very slight, the\nCameron Highlanders losing the most men. One\nof the causes of the utter failure of the Dervish\nexpedition was the dreadful character of the country\nlying between the frontier and Dongola, -the wild\nbarren desert. The Dervish transport and com-\nmissariat arrangements or rather want of arrange-\nment-caused terrible suffering, enough to destroy\nthe spirit of the finest troops in the world, and\nas a result of this, the Arabs reached the battlefield\nin an emaciated and worthless condition. After\ntheir defeat the Dervishes fell back on Kerma.\nIn April, 1886, all the British troops were with-\ndrawn to WADY HALFA, and the Dervishes advanced\nand occupied Sarras.

Khartoum was\nlevelled to the ground in August, 1885, seven\nmonths after its capture, and two months after the\nMahdi's death, and the village OMDURMAN, on the\nopposite side of the river, sprang into importance as\nthe capital of the Khalifa's dominions.\nThe Mahdi had divided the Dervish¹ army into\nthree parts, each under a commander-in-chief called a\nKhalifa. The chief of these was Abdullah, and it\nhad long been agreed that in the event of the\nMahdi's death he should succeed him. Each\nKhalifa had his own Jehadiah, or regular troops, a\ndistinctive flag, and a war-drum-\" naha\"-made of\nbrass instead of wood. Abdullah's flag was black,\nand he had also, as peculiar to his entourage, a\npowerful wind instrument-called \"onbya\"-made\nof an elephant's tusk. Each Khalifa had a number of\nEmirs 2 under him, and each Emir had his own\nbanner.\nIt was impossible for the Khalifa to do aught else\nthan carry on campaigns, for aggressive expeditions\n1 The word \"Dervish\" signifies \"poor.\" Originally it denoted\nmuch the same amongst Mohammedans as \"monk\" amongst Christians\nor \"fakir\" with Hindoos; but now-a-days the word has quite lost its\nreligious significance, and can only be looked upon as expressive of a\nfanatical slave-dealer. In fact, the Dervish army was originally a\n\"salvation army,\" but to perpetrate a pun-it took to preying instead\nof praying !\n2 The title \"Emir\" really means \"chief,\" and is, in fact, the same\nword as Ameer, which we know, for instance, in Afghanistan: it is\nreally much too high a title for the wretched officers of the Dervish\narmy.\n:\n:\n:\n"
"\n26\nPART I\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nformed the only means of distracting the attention\nof his subjects from their lamentable condition, and\nfrom the broken promises of the Mahdi. Before his\ndeath the latter had, in his imagination, dreamed of\nthe conversion of the world by force of arms, and\nthe first step in this great war was to be the conquest\nof Egypt. The idea of such an enterprise was\nreceived with acclamation by the Mahdists. The\nyoung Dervish leader, WAD EL NEJUMI, was en-\ntrusted with this ambitious enterprise, but, in con-\nsequence of the numerous calls on the Dervishes for\ndefensive operations, the expedition was postponed\nuntil a favourable opportunity might present itself.\nAs an instance of the popularity of this project, a\nsong was composed with a refrain \"To Cairo,\"\nwhich was sung everywhere. The first serious\nfrontier attack under the Khalifa's régime took place\nat Ginniss, and has been already described.¹ This\nreverse to the Khalifa's arms was a severe blow to\nhim, and one that well-nigh brought about his over-\nthrow. After the Mahdi's death the cruel despotism\nof the Khalifa and his Baggara had further spread\ndiscontent. The other tribes saw that it was only\nin the interest of the Baggara that the Khedive's\nrule had been overthrown; and several tribes re-\nsolved to endure this state of things no longer.\nThe earliest and most important revolt against\nthe Khalifa was the rising of the Kababish Arabs.\nThey had never been really hostile to the Egyptian\nGovernment, and proved themselves a sharp thorn\n1 P. 22.\n"

The overthrow of the\nlatter was not so much the definite object of this\nrebellion as the capture of that most fertile province\nDongola, to possess which had long been the\nambition of this tribe. They attempted to obtain\nthe assistance of the Egyptian Government, but it\nwas not expedient that such assistance could be\ngiven. This rising was followed by outbreaks\nagainst the Khalifa in Kordofan and Sennâr;\nand the calls on the Khalifa's strength increased\ndaily.\nAbdullah might put down rebellion after rebellion,\nbut he was only able to put the flame out, and the\nsmouldering hidden fire still remained. Besides\nthese internal revolts, his armies were contending\nin all directions on his borders. Osman Digna\nmade his periodical assaults on the Red Sea\nLittoral; Wad el Nejumi was gathering together\nhis army for the invasion of Egypt, and the Dervish\narmy on the Abyssinian frontier was being held in\ncheck by King John.\nAt the end of 1886 the Soudan was in a ferment,\nand the condition of the natives was becoming daily\nmore deplorable. The Khalifa compelled every\navailable male in his vast dominions to serve in his\narmies, and the men being drawn away from the\ncultivation of the soil, the crops were not sown,\nwith the result that food became very scarce.\nFamine and disease spread through the length and\nbreadth of the Soudan, and the inhabitants were\ndecimated.\n"
"28\nPART I\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nThese internal troubles restricted the aggression\nof the Dervishes. The only province which re-\nmained free from the Dervish yoke was the Equa-\ntorial Province (Equatoria), in which EMIN Pasha\nwas located, and it is more than probable that, but\nfor the circumstances explained above, the Khalifa's\nsway would have reached the equator. After the\nMahdi's conquests, Emin found great difficulty in\nmaintaining his position, though this was not due\nto external attack. A portion of his troops rebelled\nand occupied the country north of Wadelai.\nDuring Gordon's rule well-organised postal arrange-\nments had been established, but on the accession of\nthe Mahdi all means of reliable communication with\nLado and Khartoum were cut off, and great anxiety\nwas felt as to the position of Emin and his Central\nAfrican province. It was not until the end of 1886\nthat news of Emin came, brought by a fellow-\ncountryman, Dr. Junker. The famous Emin Relief\nExpedition, led by Mr. H. M. Stanley, is familiar\nto all readers of In Darkest Africa. The ex-\npedition started up the Congo on the 25th of\nFebruary, 1887, and, after undergoing incredible\ndangers and hardships, through famine, disease, and\nnative opposition, they fell in with Emin on Lake\nNyanza, on the 18th of January, 1889. Emin\nremained at his post until he was compelled, through\nthe mutiny of his officers, to retire at the end of\n1889; since when the province became lost to\ncivilising influences, and the last trace of Gordon's\nwork was blotted out.\n"

At the\nend of the year the Khalifa's troops, which had been\nvictorious against the rebellion in Darfur, had to\ncope with a formidable rising on the Blue Nile, and\nwith the harassing attacks of the Abyssinians.\nIn 1888 the district around Suakin claims our\nspecial attention, but before proceeding to describe\nthe events of this year, it will be necessary to\nglance at what had been happening in that neigh-\nbourhood during the years that immediately pre-\nceded it.\nAfter the defeat of Osman Digna in March, 1885,\nat McNeill's zariba, at the close of the last cam-\npaign, Osman desisted from his attacks on Suakin.\nThe Arabsin that neighbourhood became discontented\nwith the rule of the Khalifa, and they combined,\nunder the judicious advice of Colonel KITCHENER 3-\nthe Commandant at Suakin to overthrow Osman\nDigna.\nThe latter was compelled to retreat\nfrom his stronghold Tamai in October, 1886, and\nthese friendly Arabs effectually kept him in check for\n1 Now Colonel Sir Herbert C.

The internal\ntroubles had well-nigh exhausted the strength of\nthe Arabs in the Central Soudan, and Osman\nDigna rested at Handoub with his shattered army,\nwhilst the tribes around Suakin were evincing the\nstrongest hostility to him, and threatening his\nextinction.\nThis brings us to the year 1888. There was\nnow but little trouble on the frontier near Wady\nHalfa, and the whole of the Dervish force available\nwas concentrated in the neighbourhood of Suakin.\nIn January Colonel Kitchener made a well-planned\nattack to capture Osman Digna at his camp, and was\nall but successful.

The\nwar between these races was the outcome of a long-\nstanding feud. The desire on the part of the\nMahdi and of his successor to bring the Abyssinians\nunder his sway, was the primary cause of the\nquarrel, which was intensified by the differences of\nreligion that existed between them. This war\nprogressed with varying success, and being of a\nbitter and fierce description, it taxed the Khalifa's\nmilitary strength. The Dervishes having inflicted\na severe defeat on KING JOHN, the Khalifa sent the\nlatter one of his characteristic notes, which seemed\nto his Majesty to add insult to injury, and deter-\nmined the Abyssinian King on taking his revenge.\nIn March, 1889, King John led an army against the\nDervishes, and with 150,000 met 80,000 Arabs at\nGALABAT. He had nearly routed them when he\nwas killed. With the death of King John the feud\nbetween the Dervishes and Abyssinians ceased.\nMENELIK, who was at that time King of the Shoas,\na neighbouring and feudatory state to Abyssinia,\n1\n1 The Dervishes saw a gorgeous tent in the distance, so they placed\nan old gun in position and fired a round of case-shot at it.

The\nDervishes, ignorant of the cause, followed them up, and converted the\nthreatened defeat into a decisive victory The King's retinue carried\ntheir monarch from the field of battle, but a body of Dervishes fell\nupon them, and seized the King's body, stripping and decapitating it.\nHis head was buried at Wady Halfa.\n-\n1\n:\n"

Osman Digna was\nutterly dispirited, and required no further calls on\nthe military strength of the Khalifa. It was there-\nfore a seasonable moment for Nejumi to carry out\nhis great project on Egypt.\nEarly in the year his forces, the pick of the\nDervish army, descended the Nile on this ill-fated\nexpedition, and on the 2nd of July his advance guard,\nconsisting of 3,500 Dervishes, came into conflict\nwith the Egyptian troops under Colonel Wodehouse,\nat Arguin, near Wady Halfa. A pitched battle\nensued, and the Dervishes were defeated with a loss\nof 500, whilst the Egyptians lost 70.\nEvery preparation was now taken by the English\nand Egyptian Governments to strike a decisive blow\nat this long-threatened invasion, and a strong force\nof English and Egyptian troops was collected at\nAssouan.

Owing to their inadequate commissariat\narrangements, and the dreadful country between\nDongola and Wady Halfa, the Dervishes presented\nrather a weakly appearance; but they fought with\nremarkable bravery. The battle lasted seven hours,\nand consisted chiefly of repeated desperate charges\nby the Dervishes on the British troops, which were\nrepulsed chiefly by the Hussars and Egyptian\ncavalry.

Osman himself\nfled south, accompanied by thirty horsemen.\nThe principal feature of this engagement was the\nconduct of the Egyptians. This was the first time\nthat the Egyptian troops, unaided by British, had\nbeen employed in any serious engagement. They\nwere commanded by English officers, and behaved\nsplendidly. From the half-hearted cowards that\nthey had shown themselves to be during the Mahout\nrebellion, the Egyptian fellaheen had been meta-\nmorphosed by the British officers into a reliable and\ncourageous soldiery.\nThe Red Sea Littoral was cleared of the rebels,\nand many of the leading sheikhs solicited and\nobtained pardon. A general amnesty was proclaimed,\nand there was great rejoicing among the inhabitants\nat the prospect of peace, after the prolonged and\ndevastating war. During the year 1892 Osman\nDigna attacked Tokar, but he had only a few\nhundred followers, and was easily repulsed.\nAfter the defeat of the Dervishes at Toski there\nwas no real menace to Egypt; and, except when\nFather OHRWALDER and two nuns escaped from\nOmdurman in 1891, and SLATIN appeared miracu-\nlously, a fugitive from the Khalifa's prison, four\nyears later, no news ever came from those parts.\nThis passiveness on the part of the Khalifa was\nprobably due to the condition of the inhabitants,\n"

Thus when in 1882 the rising of Arabi\nPasha demanded instant suppression, England was\nthe first to come to Egypt's assistance. France was\ngiven the opportunity of joining us, but declined.\nConsequently, after the fall of Arabi,¹ it devolved\non England alone to reconstruct the whole fabric of\ngovernment in that country; and the success of\nEngland's mission constitutes the chief grievance\nthat the French-or rather, a certain section of the\nFrench press-have against us.\nOne of the first measures adopted by the British\nafter the occupation was to disband the old army\n(of which Arabi had been Commander-in-Chief).\nThis was ended by a Khedivial decree of the 20th\nof December, 1882, which said briefly: \"The army\nis disbanded.\" The nucleus of the present Egyptian\narmy was formed in 1883, and Sir Evelyn Wood\nwas the first Sirdar.

"40\nPART I\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nof the present Egyptian army by a handful of English\nofficers is one of the most successful and remarkable\nexamples of British enterprise ever afforded in our\nhistory.\nIt now remains to be shown how Britain was\nsituated with regard to the Soudan, and what led\nher to decide on the reconquest of that country.\nIt was at England's instigation that Egypt\nabandoned the Nile provinces in 1885. It is true\nthat without British aid Egypt could not have held\nthem any longer; but that does not alter the fact\nthat the existing Ministry was responsible for the\nsurrender of those provinces, and consequently\nEngland felt under the obligation to recover them\nas soon as the internal affairs of Egypt had been\nplaced on a proper footing. It is essential to Egypt's\nexistence that those provinces must belong to Egypt\nand to no other Power. In fact, the Soudan has\nbeen called the key of Egypt, for whatever civilised\nnation controls the waters of the Upper Nile holds\nEgypt at its mercy.\nAfter the fall of Khartoum fresh dangers arose to\nthreaten England's and Egypt's interests in the\nSoudan; the same dangers, in fact, as those which we\npointed out (in the last chapter), as threatening the\nKhalifa's existence.

"CHAP. IV ENGLAND'S POSITION IN EGYPT\n41\nbetween the Powers was proceeding slowly, perhaps,\nbut none the less surely; and the rumours which\nreached these shores from time to time began to\nattract considerable attention. The French, we\nfound, were gradually extending their influence from\nthe south-west, and the Belgians were sending out\nexpeditions from the south, whilst the Abyssinians\nwere proving themselves an important power in the\nsouth-east.\nThus it was that a certain amount of uneasiness\nwas beginning to make itself felt, and it was\ngenerally considered by the Cabinet that some action\non the part of Great Britain would be desirable as\nsoon as a favourable opportunity should present itself.\nSuddenly the news of a serious reverse to the\nItalians in Abyssinia brought matters to a crisis.\nThe battle of ADOWA, on Sunday, the 1st of March,\n1896, dealt a death-blow to Italy's colonial aspira-\ntions. The Italians, numbering 37,000 under General\nBaratieri, were defeated by 80,000 Abyssinians under\nMenelik, with a loss of 7,000 killed, wounded, and\nmissing. Baratieri himself was wounded, and the\nAbyssinians captured 1,500 prisoners and fifty-two\nguns. The consternation felt in England and Egypt\nat this disaster deepened when it became known that\nKASSALA, which was held by the Italian forces, was\nhemmed in, and seriously threatened by 10,000 Der-\nvishes, and that Osman Digna was marching there\nwith reinforcements. If Kassala fell into the hands of\nthe Dervishes, the latter would be let loose to overrun\nthe Nile valley on the frontier of Egypt, and threaten\n"

As if in anticipation of these\nreinforcements, the Dervishes suddenly assumed an\noffensive attitude, and it was rumoured that a large\nbody of Dervishes were contemplating an immediate\nadvance on Egypt, and were threatening the strategic\nposts of Murat Wells (near Wady Halfa), and\nKokreb (between Berber and Suakin).\nThe British Government had, for some months\npreviously, been in communication with the Egyptian\nGovernment and their military advisers, as to the\nmeans to be adopted in case of Dervish attacks, but\nthere had been no intention up to then to do anything\nmore than take measures for the defence of the\nEgyptian frontier, and no offensive measures had\nbeen contemplated. A totally new situation was now\ncreated, and immediate action was rendered impera-\ntive. Everything was ripe for an expedition up the\nNile. Whilst creating a diversion in favour of the\nItalians besieged at Kassala, it afforded an oppor-\ntunity of creating a stronger barrier than the Wady\nHalfa boundary between Egypt and the Dervishes,\nand it would moreover be an important step towards\nthe long-wished-for recovery of the Soudan.\nThe announcement of the contemplated expedi-\ntion was made in the House of Commons on the\n17th of March, 1896, by Mr. Curzon, Under-\nSecretary for Foreign Affairs. It came as a great\nsurprise to the whole country, which, having heard so\nlittle of the Dervishes of late years, was not prepared\nfor a recrudescence of the Soudan question.

This is explained\nvery plainly and concisely in the Annual Register,\n1896,¹ which we quote at length :-\n\"In order to defray the cost of the undertaking, it being obviously\ndesirable to impose as little strain as possible on the slowly recovering\nfinances of Egypt, it was determined by the Egyptian Government to\napply for an advance of £500,000 from the General Reserve Fund of\nthe Caisse de la Dette, and the authorities of the Caisse obligingly\nhanded over the money.... However, the French and Russian\nmembers of the Caisse de la Dette protested against the loan which\nthe Caisse had made. The Caisse was cited, at the instance of the\nFrench bondholders' syndicate, to appear before the Mixed Tribunals,\nto answer for the misappropriation of its reserve funds. As the year\nwore on, the Mixed Tribunals pronounced against the loan. In\nDecember (1896) the International Court of Appeal required the\nEgyptian Government to refund to the Caisse the £500,000 which\nthey had secured. The very next day Lord Cromer offered an English\nloan to make good the advance. The Egyptian Government accepted\nhis offer, and repaid immediately the £500,000 to the Caisse, and the\nresult of this somewhat absurd transaction is that England has thus\nstrengthened her hold in another small point on the Government of\nEgypt.\"\nThe verdict of the Court of Appeal was given on\nthe grounds that the Caisse required the unanimous\nconsent of the commissioners before they could\nspend the money. From this it is apparent that\nany one commissioner has more real power than the\nKhedive himself, and can, no matter what be his\n1 Published by Longmans, Green and Co.\n"

For Egypt\nto be at the mercy of any one Power seems as\nintolerable as it is unique; and it behoves England\nto assert her position, more than ever, as the\ndominant factor in Egyptian politics and adminis-\ntration. The benefits and blessings which the\nBritish occupation has bestowed upon Egypt, the\ninability of that country to stand alone amidst the\ndangers that beset her, and the resources that will\nbe required to develop the Soudanese provinces\nwhich have been reconquered, are only links in the\nchain that binds Egypt to her powerful ally.\nHow the irritating and meaningless policy adopted\nby certain of our neighbours across the water can\nachieve any useful purpose from their own point\nof view it is difficult to conceive, and it must be\napparent to any one not blinded by jealousy that it\nis to Egypt's interest that the day of evacuation, if\nit ever comes, should be a very long way off.\n"

They were, at the outset, Surgeon-\nMajor Sloggett, A.M.S., Surgeon-Captain Carr,\nA.M.S., Captain Morgan, A.S.C., Captain Smith,\nA.P.D., and the Rev. A. W. Watson, C.F. The\ndepartmental mess was strengthened at Halfa by\nLieutenant Elkington, R.E., and Surgeon-Captain\nHolmes, A.M.S.-these two having gone on a few\ndays in advance-and subsequently Captain Mathew,\nA.O.D., Surgeon-Captains Pinches and Reily, and\nthe Rev. Father Brindle, C.F., came up the river\nand joined us.\nThe boats 1 were crowded; the Rameses carried\nnearly 400 men, though only intended originally for\n70 of Cook's tourists; but in spite of this the time\n1 Messrs. Cook and Son had eight of these boats on the river be-\ntween Cairo and the frontier.

The band generally played in the evening,\nthe \"Dervish Chorus\" and \"To the Front\" being\namongst the favourite tunes.\nThe Nile was too low to allow us to go by night,\nfrom fear of running on the numerous sand-banks ;\nso at dusk we used to moor up for the night off\nsome village, where we could take in fresh pro-\nvisions, and started again at daybreak. In spite of\nthe intimate knowledge of the whereabouts of sand-\nbanks which the reis (captain) possessed-or said\nhe did and in spite of the men in the bows who\nwere continually sounding with their long poles, the\nboat made several attemps at \"breaking the bank.\"\nOccasionally we did try to go by night, but we had\nnever gone far on our way before the steamer would\nsuddenly bump on a bank, and awake us and the\nman at the wheel! with a start.\nThe first night (24th) was spent off Farshut,\nwhich we left at daybreak.\nOn the 26th we reached Luxor, and as we\nstopped there most of the day, we were able to visit\nits monuments. The Temple of Luxor, by the\nwater's edge, was the first object of interest, and\nthen we went to Karnak and saw the gigantic\nTemple of Ammon, with its hall of 134 columns-\na veritable forest of stone. Some of us crossed to\nthe left bank and paid a flying visit to Thebes,\nwhose Collossi we saw looking across the desert,\nfive miles off.\n"
"CHAP. I THE START. CAIRO TO WADY HALFA\n53\nThe next day took us past Edfoo, Esneh, and\nKom-Ombo, with their great temples by the river-\nbank.\nExactly a week after leaving Cairo we reached\nAssouan (29th) at the foot of the First Cataract.\nThe latter was skirted by a light single-line railway\nto Shellal, which was on the upper reach of the\nriver, opposite Philæ.\nThe only train available was\nrequired to convey our stores, the work of transfer-\nring which was being done by gangs of convicts in\nchains. By 4 P.M. this was completed, and the\nbattalion fell in to march to Shellal. As we passed\nthrough Assouan, with the band playing, crowds of\nnatives thronged the roadway to catch a glimpse of\na British Regiment, which they had not seen for\neleven years. It will be remembered that the\nDorsetshire regiment left a third of their number\nthere, on their return from the Soudan in 1886,\nfrom which lamentable fact they gained the soubri-\nquet of \"Dying Dorsets.\"\nOur way lay across the desert, and we were\naccompanied most of the distance by Dr. Conan\nDoyle, the author, who, with his friend Mr. Corbett,\nwas about to make the journey to Halfa on camels.1\nOn each side of our route lay immense blocks of\nsyenite, many of which were covered with ancient\nhieroglyphics, which contrasted strangely with the\nwhite numbers painted underneath them by some\n1 Dr. C. Doyle was acting as special correspondent for the West-\nminster Gazette, but he returned to England in April.\n"
"\n54\nPART II\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nenterprising guide-book publishers an example of\nthe two ages, the monumental and the practical.\nAfter four hours in the desert, we reached Shellal,\nand gazed for the first time on the beautiful little\nisland of Philæ. We had no time, however, to\nadmire the works of the ancients, and had to\nembark at once on the boats.\n،،\nstern-\nThe latter were four flat-bottomed\nwheelers,\" namely, the post-boats Tanjore, Kaibar,\nAkasheh, and the gunboat El Teb. They were\npropelled by a paddle-wheel in rear, whence their\nname. They only drew three feet of water, and\nthe ease with which they could be turned was mar-\nvellous. On both sides of each boat were lashed\ndouble-decked barges, specially built for the pur-\npose of carrying troops, the officers and the baggage\nbeing on the steamer itself. The stores were all on\nboard by nightfall, and we started southwards again\nnext morning.\nBelow the Second Cataract the Nile has been\ndescribed probably more than any river in the\nworld. We will therefore refrain from going into a\nlengthy account of it now, but will only give a few\nimpressions that struck us as we journeyed on.\nEgypt has been described as the land of tranquil\nmonotony, and what applies to Egypt is equally\napplicable to the Nile, for the two are practically\nsynonymous. Below Assouan the country is well\ncultivated, and presents a fertile and flourishing\naspect. Along the banks the ever-creaking sakiehs,\n"
"CHAP. I THE START. CAIRO TO WADY HALFA\n55\nor water-wheels turned by oxen, and the shadoufs,\nor water-lifts worked by the fellaheen, are con-\nstantly seen; and the scenery is largely made up\nof date-palms, herds of goats and sheep, and fields\nof dhurra.\nFrom Assouan right up to Kosheh the scenery is\nquite different. The land yields nothing and sup-\nports nothing. The scenery consists only of rocks\nand sand, with here and there a strip of cultivation\non the river-bank, only a few yards in width.\nGreat black hillocks abound, of such exact pyramid\nshape that-when we first saw them-we could not\nhelp thinking they must have suggested the idea\nof erecting those ancient monuments.\nIn some\nplaces there are a few palms and an occasional\nmiserable village or so, but most of the way there is\nnothing but yellow sand right down to the water's\nedge. Yet in spite of this, as Professor Rawlinson\nremarks,¹ \"the Nubian river is grander than the\nEgyptian: in the grandeur of its deserts, the sense\nof unending space which the mind begins to grasp\nwhen the sun sets in the western sky, in all but its\ntemples, and these, too, are represented, though\nthey are not so numerous. The Nile itself is too\nwide, as a rule, to be picturesque. Its average\nwidth is probably half a mile, but at places it is\nas much as two miles. The water is never clear.\nDuring the inundation it is deeply stained with the\nred argillaceous soil brought down from the Abys-\nsinian highlands. At other seasons it is always\n1 Egypt-\"Story of the Nations\" series.\n:\n:\n"

Some were seen at Kosheh, but th\nmajority of us went to Dongola and back withou\nseeing a single crocodile. Thirty years ago they were\nplentiful at Luxor, but in the campaign of 1884-5\nthey were only first seen in any numbers at Debbeh\nand now that the steamers have again invaded their\npeaceful haunts, there is little doubt that below the\nSixth Cataract the crocodile will very soon be\nunknown.\nWe reached Korosko late on the 31st. Here the\ncaravans start for Abu Hamed, cutting off the great\nbend of the Nile—or rather used to start, for at the\ntime of our visit there was no trade in this devastated\ndistrict.

It is one of the\ngrandest works on the Nile, and, as the guide-book\nobserves, is alone worth the journey above Assouan.\nAt the foot of one of the statues lies the tomb of\nMajor Tidwell, R. E., who died in the Nile Expedi-\ntion of 1885. The striking feature about this great\nruin is that it is entirely cut out of the solid\nrock, with a door only fifteen feet high and eight\nbroad. We learn from Baedeker that the ears of\nthese colossi are six feet in length, and other similar\ndetails, but they, like all Egyptian monuments, must\nbe seen to be appreciated.\nAfter breakfast on the 2nd of April there\nwas a cry of \"Man overboard!\" and we saw a close-\ncropped head bobbing rapidly down stream. For-\ntunately he fell off the leading boat, so that one of\nthose behind was able to pick him up, none the\nworse for his ducking.

Dongola\nwas to be taken, but by Dongola was understood\nthe province, and not merely the town, for the\nlatter would be a very insecure frontier post.\nBy the beginning of April the greater part of the\nexpeditionary force had arrived at Wady Halfa,\nSarras, and Akasheh. Sarras had been for the\nlast few years the advanced post of the Egyptian\nFrontier Force. On the 20th of March Akasheh\nhad been occupied by an advanced column under\nMajor Collinson, without any resistance being met\nwith. A fort was at once constructed, and an\nentrenched camp formed.

In consequence\nof this a force started to his assistance, from Suakin,\non the 15th of April in co-operation with the detach-\nment stationed at Tokar.\nThe force was composed as follows:-Commanding:\nLieutenant-Colonel Lloyd (South Staffordshire\nRegiment); Chief Staff Officer: Captain Souter\n(Black Watch); Brigade Major: Captain Judge\n"
"CHAP.

The deficiencies were made up by mules\nand donkeys, there being 60 of the former and 120\nof the latter. Two hundred Arabs accompanied the\ncolumn to hold the camels when the troops halted or\nformed square. The mules carried the guns, the\nartillery ammunition, and the reserve infantry am-\nmunition, while the donkeys carried the stretchers,\nentrenching implements, and the signalling equipment.\nThe artillery ammunition consisted of 200 rounds\nshell, and each man was provided with 200 cartridges.\nEvery camel carried six days' forage and rations, one\nday's reserve of water in skins, and a blanket.\n"
"70\nPART II\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nThe force paraded outside the walls of Suakin at\n5 P.M. on the 14th, and bivouacked there. At day-\nbreak on the 15th it started for the Teroi Wells.\nThe progress at first was slow. Most of the camels\nnever having had a saddle on their backs before,\nbecame irritated with them and threw off their\nburdens. By the exercise of great patience, however,\nmatters righted themselves, and more satisfactory\nprogress was made.\nAfter marching four or five hours the cavalry met\na number of Dervish scouts, who retired. The\ncolumn now marched in square formation, the front\nface of which consisted of the 9th and 10th Soudanese\ndetachments, with the guns in the centre. The\nCamel Corps formed the rear and flank guards on the\nmove, and the rear face when halted. The hospital\ncorps and baggage was in the centre of the square.\nThe country, after a time, became very difficult,\nbeing intercepted by a broad watercourse encumbered\nwith loose rocks and thorn bushes, whilst high hills\non each side rendered vigilant scouting indispensable,\nmore especially as a large body of Dervishes was\nknown to be in the neighbourhood.\nThe Teroi Wells were reached in the afternoon,\nthe column having covered a distance of nineteen\nmiles. Here the force bivouacked. The cavalry\nwas now sent to reconnoitre, and to endeavour to\nestablish touch with the Tokar force, and to inform\nthe officer commanding the latter that Colonel\nLloyd would remain at the wells for the night.

Fenwick's\nparty retired at a trot, but it was soon seen that the\nDervish horsemen were gaining on them fast, so\nthey galloped towards the open country, where\nmany of them became entangled in the bush, or\nwere tripped up by the uneven ground, and, falling\noff, were instantly speared by the Dervishes.\nFenwick withdrew to the rear flank and ascended\na hillock, where he and his men kept the enemy\noff by firing volleys. About 200 horsemen and\n1,000 footmen attacked, and the small handful of\nEgyptians were threatened throughout the night by\nmasses of Dervish swordsmen and spearmen moving\nround and round the base of the hill and collecting\nfor a charge. Happily there were very few riflemen\namong them, and the fire from these was erratic.\nCaptain Fenwick himself fired 120 single shots\nduring the night, and encouraged his men in every\nway. He was well backed up by two Egyptian\nofficers-lieutenants in the cavalry.\nAt last the enemy drew off, and Fenwick suc-\nceeded in leading his men through the scrub back\nto the Teroi Wells.

Owing to the thick-\nness of the bush and the roughness of the country,\nthe troops were obliged to proceed on foot. The\ncamels were not required, and the food and reserve\nammunition was sent on towards the hills held by\nOmar's men.\nIn the evening, when the Suakin force arrived at\nthe Khor Wintri, they found the Tokar contingent,\nunder Major Sidney, in possession of the place.\nSidney had surprised the enemy at the Khor on\nthe previous afternoon, and they had retired up\nthe pass. As soon as he had arrived at the Khor,\nthe Dervishes, about 700 strong, were seen advancing\nup the pass. The column formed square and opened\nfire on them. The enemy twice attempted to turn\nthe column's right flank and rear, but in each instance\nwere met by a heavy fire, causing them to eventually\nretreat up the pass, with a loss of forty killed and\nmany wounded.\nShortly after the junction of the Suakin and\nTokar forces, Omar Tita arrived and reported that\nhis tribesmen had abandoned the heights and pass\n"

A large number of Dervishes deserted\ntheir leader and fled to the hills, and, to add to\ntheir general discomfort, the scarcity of food began\nto make itself keenly felt in Osman's camp.\nDuring May it was decided to send a contingent\nof Indian troops to Suakin, so as to relieve the\nEgyptian battalions, which were required on the\nNile.

"CHAPTER IV\nWADY HALFA\nIts situation-Raids-Description of the place-Wingate and Slatin-\nCamel Corps-The black recruits-Daily routine-Our quarters\n-The war correspondents-Native dance-The end of the day.\nWADY HALFA, situated five miles north of the\nSecond Cataract, first came into prominent notice\nin 1886, when it was selected as the frontier station\nof Egypt. The reason for this selection was that\nto the south of Halfa lies a vast stony wilderness,\nthe Batn-el-Hagar, or \"Belly of Rocks,\" which\nforms an impassable barrier to any invading force\nof savages; parties of depredators have managed\nto get through it from time to time, but never in\nsufficient force to threaten the tranquillity of Egypt.1\nHalfa was attacked in October, 1887, and in July,\n1888, but each time the Dervishes were repulsed\nwith considerable loss. In 1892 Osman Azrak\n1 What General Gordon wrote twenty years ago is equally true\nto-day: \"From Wady Halfa southwards to Hannek, a distance of 180\nmiles, an utter desert extends, spreading also for miles eastwards and\nwestwards on both sides of the Nile. For the same length the river\nis also encumbered with ridges of rock.\nIt was therefore this\nboundary that kept the warlike and independent tribes of the Soudan\nquite apart from the inhabitants of Egypt proper, and has made the\nSoudanese and Egyptians two distinct people.\"\n"
"76\nPART II\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nraided the villages in the neighbourhood, and\nseveral raids were committed subsequently, but\nseldom with any more serious result than one or\ntwo villagers being wounded, and their goats and\nbullocks driven off. The last raid, prior to the\nDongola expedition, was in December, 1895, whilst\nGeneral Knowles was actually making an inspection\nof the garrison there.\nWady Halfa comprises the two villages of Tew-\nfikieh and Halfa, and the fortified lines - all on\nthe east bank. The first thing one sees, coming up\nthe river from Assouan, is the white minaret of the\nmosque of the village Tewfikieh. This village con-\ntained the only shops (of European goods) in Upper\nNubia; in one street-the Regent Street of Halfa-\nnearly all the shopkeepers were Greeks. The\nvillage of Halfa proper consists of some two dozen\nmud huts, situated at the foot of the Second\nCataract, amongst thick palm groves and many\nacres of \"halfa\" grass, from which the district takes\nits name.\nIt is the \"lines,\" the combined Aldershot and\nWoolwich of Nubia, with which we and the general\npublic are chiefly concerned. They lie midway\nbetween Halfa and Tewfikieh-from each of which\nthey are about ten minutes' walk. Every building\nis of mud unadorned, the roadway is the sandy\ndesert soil, and there is no wheeled traffic of any\nsort, an occasional camel or donkey being the only\nmeans of transport.

We saw a good deal\nof these two during that wearisome period of wait-\ning, and they frequently dined in our mess. To\nlook at Slatin, with his cheery manner, one could\nhardly believe that he had gone through such dread-\nful experiences, and had witnessed the last days\nof Khartoum, even to gazing upon the severed head\nof its defender!\nMajor Wingate was full of anecdotes, and one good\nstory which he told us deserves repetition.

It was formerly the railway\nterminus, but it was found more convenient to have\nthe latter nearer the river-bank. Outside the hospital\nis a tree under which lies buried the head of King\nJohn of Abyssinia. The head was sent from\nOmdurman to Halfa after the battle of Galabat,\ntogether with some documents which were forwarded\nto England. Speaking of this reminds us of the\nlittle British cemetery, which lies out in the desert\nbeyond the walls. When we first arrived there were\nabout eighty graves, chiefly of those who had died\nduring the last Nile Expedition; but, alas! by the\ntime we left for Cairo it was crowded to the utmost\nof its capacity. Here lies young Cameron of the\n79th, surrounded by six of his men, who all fell at\nGinniss-and many others who are waiting for the\n\"Great Reveillé.\"\nNext to the railway station were the workshops,\nincluding the engine \"hospital,\" which was never\nwithout one or two inmates. To say that Halfa at\nthis time was like a gigantic beehive is to speak\ninadequately, as any one will acknowledge who ever\nstood between the river and the railway and watched\nthe fatigue parties hard at work, all day long, carry-\ning stores from the boats to the trains. Corn and\nrailway material formed the greatest part of the\nloads, which, when not borne by convicts in chains\n(under the eyes of armed sentries), were carried by\nthe soldiers. To see those Egyptians working\nunder the broiling sun filled one with admiration.\n"
"CHAP. IV\n79\nWADY HALFA\nThere was no need for non-commissioned officers to\nstir them up; they all went at it fully alive to\nthe fact that 10,000 of their comrades at the front\nwere depending on their labours for their daily\nrations. It was a case of \"corn in Egypt,\" indeed!\nWe have frequently heard it said that the Egyptian\nsoldier is the ideal fatigue man and the Soudanese\nthe ideal fighting man-this is more or less true,\nbut at the same time we must add the Egyptian\nsoldier is something better than a mere beast of\nburden, and has been turned into a valuable soldier\n-a conviction which we feel sure the reader will\nshare before he closes this book.\nHalfa was the headquarters of the Camel Corps,\nand all day long the men were being drilled and\nyoung camels were being brought in and trained.\nThe corps was a most important feature of the\nexpedition; it afforded great assistance to the Trans-\nport Department, and, in the later stages, was\ninvaluable for reconnoitring work.\nWhilst the camels were being exercised in the\ndesert, outside the walls, the barrack squares were\nresounding with the voice of the drill-sergeant.\nHere the jet-black recruits were first initiated into\nthe mysteries of the goose-step by very smart\nEnglish non-commissioned-officers, and very amus-\ning it was to watch them. The average Sambo,\non enlistment, had not the faintest idea of how\nto count, and when these recruits \"numbered\"\nand \"formed fours, \"the result was exasperating to\nthe instructor-at least, we presume so, judging\n"

One night, when we had been there a week,\nwe were disturbed in our sleep by the shouts of\none of the sentries, and in almost less time than it\ntakes to narrate every company fell in opposite its\nbarrack-room. But it turned out to be a false\nalarm, caused by a young over-excited sentry, and\nwe were not troubled by any more scares of that\nnature.\nWith the exception of occasional fatigues, there\nwas not much work for us to do. It was a dread-\nfully slow time, waiting for a chance of doing some-\nthing, and at times we began to despair of ever\ngoing up to the front (Akasheh) at all. What\nmade it a hundred times worse was the way in\nwhich utterly groundless rumours were incessantly\nflying round: first, that we were going back to\nCairo at once; then that we would never go south\n"

As it\nturned out in the end, a certain number of us were\nleft behind. It quite took the life out of one,\nliving under such disheartening circumstances in\nthat awful heat, and no wonder that the sick list\nafter a time became abnormally large.\nOur daily routine was monotony exemplified. In\nthe morning we went into the desert and practised\nsquare formations and the stereotyped attack drill,\nand some of the companies went through the annual\ncourses of musketry and field training! After\nlunch every one changed into pyjamas and slept,\nread, or played picquet or whist. The heat from\n10 till 5 was more than we can attempt to\ndescribe - but the natives have a saying that\n\"the ground is like fire and the wind like flame,\"\nwhich we can vouch for as being literally true,\nand the place was commonly spoken of as \"Wady\nHell-fire\"!\nThe afternoon was usually well advanced before\nwe were able to leave our quarters. The latter\nwere like barns when we first went into them.\nThere were two officers in each room. There was\nno floor but the ground, no paper, but white(sic)-\nwashed walls, and, of course, no glass in the window,\nso that when a dust-storm blew, we had to close the\nG\n"

The only articles of furni-\nture we found on our arrival were native bedsteads,\ncalled angareebs, made of fibre strung on a rough\nwooden frame. The rooms swarmed with every\nspecies of vermin. In ours, for instance, we counted\ntwo birds' nests and two hornets' nest, to say nothing\nof scorpions, rats, mice, beetles, and noisome insects\ninnumerable. However, by dint of much scrubbing\nand sweeping we managed at last to make ourselves\ntolerably comfortable.\nThere were a few sailing-boats to be had, of a\nprimitive cut and rig, in which we sometimes went\nfor a sail up to the cataract, or explored the ruined\ntemple on the opposite bank. There was a racquet-\ncourt, which had been built at a small cost by the\nEnglish officers of the Egyptian army; though\nmade of mud and rather undersized, it was an im-\nmense boon in such a place.\nWhatever form of recreation we took, we usually\ncongregated before dinner at the \"Club,\" as the\nEgyptian mess was called. All its original owners\nbeing at the front, this establishment was now used\nby the waifs and strays in Halfa, chiefly the war\ncorrespondents. We saw a good deal of the latter,\nand very cheery companions they were. Some of\nthem had a mess of their own, near the Sirdar's\nquarters, and afterwards, when we all moved south,\nthey messed in couples.

On the left bank of\nthe Nile were the friendly Kababish Arabs,\nmounted on camels, who effectually stopped any\nattempts at retreat on the part of the Dervishes in\nthat direction.\nThe enemy held three distinct positions ¹-first,\nthe Jaalin camp, then the Jehadia camp, and lastly,\nwhere their final stand was made, the Baggara camp.\nOur troops advanced across the plain in good\norder, pouring in steady volleys, and then rushing\nforward some yards, just as regularly as if \"doing the\nattack\" on parade; whilst the Horse Artillery and\nthe Maxims fired away as hard as they could. The\nofficers with the latter under Captain Laurie were\nespecially conspicuous, and Lieutenants Goldfinch\n(North Staffords) and Blunt (Connaught Rangers)\nwere seen themselves pulling their guns over the\nrough ground in order to get closer to the enemy.\n1 See Plan, page 94.\n"

The 10th Soudanese circled its\nleft round, so that the enemy were caught on two\nsides. The 3rd Battalion, led by Captain Sillem,\ncharged a large body of Baggaras in fine style.\nThe 4th Battalion, on the other hand, under Captain\nSparkes, were charged by a body of desperate\nBaggara horsemen, but they repulsed them with\nsteady volleys. There was a lot of hand-to-hand\nfighting in the huts; no quarter was given and none\nasked.\nThe 2nd Brigade was sent against the Jehadia\ncamp, and had very rough, hilly ground to\nwork on. They advanced over it at a sharp pace,\nstopping repeatedly to pour in volleys, and then\ncharging the enemy along the hill-tops.\nThe 3rd Brigade came up later and deployed\ninto fighting line to fill the gap between the Ist\nand 2nd Brigades. They were, through no fault\nof their own, too late to take much part in the\nfighting.\nThe Dervishes fought with their customary bull-\ndog pluck, but were too greatly outnumbered.\nEven when compelled to retire, owing to the fire\ngetting too hot for them, they would walk away\nslowly and calmly, with the rifle sloped carelessly on\nthe shoulder, as if disdaining to recognise our pres-\nence, much less our superiority.

Some had made for a small island, where they\nhad resolved to make a last stand, but some troops\nwere sent to rout them out, which did not take\nlong.\nAs a result of the morning's work our losses were\n20 killed and 80 wounded, including Captain Legge,\nwho got a cut on the wrist whilst leading a charge.\nIt is hard to ascertain the enemy's losses, but they\nmust have lost quite a thousand, including at least\n40 Emirs.

Over 500 prisoners were taken, besides\na quantity of arms, ammunition, camels, goats and\nhorses. Some of the latter were sent down to\nWady Halfa and were put up for auction, but they\nwere such miserable beasts that none fetched more\nthan a few shillings.\nThis battle was the most decisive fight in the\nDongola Expedition. It was certainly not a glorious\nvictory, for our troops were superior in numbers,\nbetter armed, and had the advantage of surprise on\ntheir side, making the defeat of the Dervishes a\nforegone conclusion.

Gemai is half-way\nbetween Halfa and Sarras; apart from our camp it\nconsisted merely of a fort on the top of a hill over-\nlooking the river, and a few mud huts. The railway\nran within a hundred yards of the river, through\nthe middle of the camp, and the arrival of two or\nthree trains which passed through on their way\nto the front with stores, or down to Halfa with\ninvalids, was the only event that broke the monotony\nof the dreary camp life.\nBehind the camp rose the great black hills which\nextend for eighty miles along the east side of the\nNile, and are known as the Batn-el-Hagar, or \"Belly\nof Rocks.\" Black rugged rocks are everywhere\nheaped together in endless confusion; some are hills\nof a thousand feet high, some are only a hundred\nfeet. They are separated by \"wadies,\" or valleys,\nwhich once or twice a year become raging torrents,\nbut are most of the time as dry as their cindery sur-\nroundings. The \"abomination of desolation\" is\nhere attained, and no sign of life is visible, with the\nexception of a few small birds-whose black plumage\nis in harmony with their surroundings and an\noccasional jackal or vulture.\nDuring the first three weeks of July, three hundred\nfatal cases of cholera occurred amongst the natives at\nWady Halfa.\nThe cholera tracked us to Gemai.\nOne after another of our men was carried off by it;\nand for the greater part of July our existence might\nbe summed up in the question \"Whose turn next?\"\nH\n"

That class of officer, however, is\nhappily extinct; and the officer of to-day realises that\nit is his duty to interest himself in his men's welfare\nto the best of his ability; and the soldier is\nbeginning to learn that his best friend is his officer.\nBut we are digressing.\nOn the 11th of July we heard that \"Roddy\" Owen 1\nhad fallen a victim to the cholera at Ambigole Wells,\nwhere he was in command of the camp, being the\nonly white man there.

A\ngroup would silently gather outside the hospital\ntent, and the mournful little cortége would make\nits way, by the light of a couple of lanterns, to\nthe cemetery, where the chaplain awaited them,\nhis clean, white surplice forming a marked contrast\nto the rough kharki of the others.

Poor \"Jock\"! He had a bad time when we\nleft Halfa for Gemai, for he was at the time laid up\nwith fever, and had to be left behind. The orderly\nwho attended him in hospital was seized with cholera\nand died; the only other orderly and the doctors\nwere so overworked that Rose saw little or nothing\nof them so he literally took up his bed and walked,\nand got into the first train he could find bound for\nGemai.

The battalions were\nscattered in a manner which had little the appearance\nof a frontier camp. As an example of how rapidly\nthe change of camp was effected, the 9th Soudanese\nmarched out of Kosheh at 5 A.M., and by 10 A.M.\ntheir new quarters had been erected in the desert.\nThese tokuls are made of palm branches; the roof\nis made first and set upon the uprights, and then the\nwalls are built round. The Soudanese are very\nskilful at making these habitations.\nBy the middle of August the last traces of cholera\nhad flickered out. The heat at this time was more\nterrific than ever, and in the straw huts, with thick\nroofs, it frequently reached 122°, and occasionally\nrose to 129°. Before five in the afternoon any form\nof exercise was out of the question: the only re-\ncreation was a walk by the river in the cool of the\nevening. Some of us took to fishing, but the fish\nwere usually too muddy to be palatable.\nWhilst we were existing at Gemai in this manner,\nthe primary causes of our inactivity were coming to\nan end, for the railway was nearing its destination,\nand the river was rising rapidly.\nAs soon as the Sirdar had moved into his new\nquarters at Kosheh (the first week in July), active\nmeasures were taken to find out what the enemy\nwere doing. Captain Mahon reconnoitred beyond\nthe Kaibar Cataract, occupied Surda without meeting\nany resistance, and ascertained that the Der-\n"

A\nfriendly chief, Abdul Azim Bey, succeeded in\nreaching the Nile, from Murat Wells, at Dar\nShagiyeh (near Merawi), and gave the natives a true\naccount of how the Dervishes had been defeated,\nwhich news was received with unconcealed delight.\nOn the 24th of July the first train ran across the\nbattlefield of Ferket, and the first week in August,\njust as the cholera came to an end, the railway was\ncompleted (for the present).\nThe first train en-\ntered Kosheh on the 4th of August, and the next\nten days were spent in forming a large coal depôt\nthere. The successful completion of the railway\nwas a source of great satisfaction to all concerned.\nIt was 105 miles long; the greatest length laid in a\nday was a mile and a half, and the work was as\narduous as anything of the kind in modern times.\nHere and there it was not laid quite as carefully as\nan English mainline, and the curves at some places\nwere very sharp, with the result that a train would\noccasionally run off the rails. One engine-driver\nwas killed, but the casualties on the railway were\nwonderfully few, all things considered.\nDuring the construction of the railway, stores had\nbeen rapidly collected at the front. The train took\nthem as far as Akasheh (or whatever point the\n\"Railhead\" had reached), thence they were taken\nby boat to the north side of the Dal Cataract, then\ncame a portage of three and a half miles, and finally\nthey were shipped in fifty boats to Kosheh and\n"

The native boats which brought them\nup were known as nuggars, or gyassas, solid one-\nmasted vessels of from ten to twenty tons burden.\nThe prevailing wind in these parts is from the\nnorth, a providential institution which to some extent\ncounteracts the great natural heat. It was most\nuseful in helping the boats up-stream, and with all\nsail set a boat used to make as much as twenty miles\na day against the current. Unfortunately, just at\nthe time when the wind was most urgently required,\nit suddenly shifted, and for the greater part of\nAugust a horrible southerly wind set in, which made\nus feel more dead than alive, and was a serious\nhandicap to the transport department, for the reasons\nexplained above.\nAs if this was not bad enough, the country was\nsuddenly visited by severe thunderstorms, an unusual\noccurrence in this district, and these were a very\nserious inconvenience. All the camps were flooded,\nand the deluge was followed, as a rule, by a violent\nsandstorm, which blew down any tents that were\nleft standing. This continued off and on for a\nfortnight; but the worst part of it was yet in store\nfor us.\n"

Four of these were gunboats,\nviz.: the Tamai, El Teb, Metemmeh, and Abu Klea,\nand the other three were unarmed post-boats-the\nKaibar, Dal, and Akasheh.\nA Nile cataract is caused by ridges of granite\ncrossing the river-bed, and causing the latter to\nfall in a series of steps. \"These obstacles some-\ntimes extend over miles of continuous water, at other\nplaces they are short and abrupt, and immediately\nabove and below them the river is smooth and\nnavigable.

Worn smooth by the\naction of the water, the sides of these cataract rocks\nare polished as a marble chimney-piece, and their\nteeth-like ridges below the water are dangerous to\nany craft that touches them. When the Nile is in\nflood it runs with tremendous force, but comparative\nsmoothness, down these rugged stairways, but as\nthe waters subside the rocks begin to show their\nheads, the angle of descent becomes steeper, and\nchannels of broken water begin to show themselves\nwhere before the river from shore to shore had been\nan unbroken volume. In these lower stages a boat,\npropelled by oars or poles, or moved by sails, or\ndragged by tow-ropes, can zigzag from rock to rock,\nwhile the force of the current is not so determined\nand continuous against her; but when the Nile is in\nfull flood, and has submerged almost all the rocks\nbeneath its waves, the descent is easier than the\nascent, and the boat, left to the current, is swept\nalong the broad river with great velocity, but with\ncomparative safety.\" 1\nOccasionally the river is pent to narrow limits\nbetween great barriers of rock, and the gorges thus\nformed, known as \"gates,\" form a very formidable\nobstacle to navigation. The Second Cataract is\nabout nine miles in length, and has a total descent\nof about sixty feet in that distance. In the narrowest\npart of it is a deep gorge known as the Bab-el-Kebir,\n1 \"The Nile Cataracts,\" read by Major-General Sir W.

An enormous churned-up mass of water rushes\nthrough the gate with immense force from a circular\npool above, where two arms of the river meet.\nThe gate itself is formed of two precipitous black\nrocks, about fifteen yards apart, and there is a fall\nof ten feet in a distance of seventy yards. Below\nthe fall is a long series of pools where the water,\nthough flowing rapidly, appears quite stationary\ncompared with the torrent above.\nAn Egyptian battalion, sent down from Kosheh,\nwas encamped by the gate, and, with the North\nStaffords, was waiting in readiness to haul the\nboats up.\nOn the 14th of August, a noticeable rise having\ntaken place in the river, the first gunboat-the\nMetemmeh was hauled through the \"gate\"; and\nevery morning during the next week we marched\nfrom Gemai to the \"gate,\" and back in the evening\nafter a really hard day's work.\n\"\nThe way the boats were pulled over the \"gate\nwas as follows:-five immense cables were attached\nto the boat, two on each side and one in front, and\nat each cable 400 men pulled with all their might.\nAt intervals of a quarter of an hour they were\nrelieved by others, one regiment being allotted to\neach cable.

The boats were designed by E. B. Thubron, Nile\nEngine Works, Cairo; the machinery was made by Messrs. Y. Stewart\nand Son, Blackwall Iron Works; and the hulls by Messrs. Forrest\nand Son, Wyvenhoe. The whole work was constructed with a view to\neach boat being transferred complete to its destination in three sections,\narmament excepted. The latter, on each boat, consisted of one 12-\npounder quick-firing (forward), two 6-pounders quick-firing, one\nhowitzer, and twelve Maxims (reduced, in 1898, to four).

Altogether twenty miles of hard\nlabour had been carried off. The telegraph was\ndestroyed, and all communication was at a stand-\nstill for two or three days. All the tents and camp\nequipment of the railway battalion were washed\ninto the Nile.\nWhen the storm broke on us at Gemai we were\nquite unprepared for it, in spite of the warnings we\nhad at the beginning of the month. A few heavy\ndrops of rain and the storm was on us. We had\nbeen having our meals out in the open by the river-\nbank, preferring a little roasting to being stifled in\na tent. Suddenly down went half the tents, away\nwent our mess table into the Nile, and away went\nthe mess-sergeant-who happened to be standing\nnear-head first after it! It is wonderful what a\nlittle excitement will do in a monotonous place\nlike that, and we felt as refreshed (especially the\nmess-sergeant !) as if we had all been for a change\nof air.\nNext day the regiment moved by train to Sarras\n"

Water depots had been estab-\nlished, but the force was overtaken by a terrific\nduststorm, and the result was disastrous. Out of\n3,000 men, 1,700 fell out, and ten died and were\nburied on the journey, which came to be spoken of\nas the \"Death March.\"\nThe Staffords were hard at work at Sarras, re-\nbuilding the embankment. Their camp was pitched\non a cemetery, and in one tent half a man's leg was\nstill to be seen above ground! There was only one\nconsolation to make up for their state of squalor at\nSarras, and that was that the detachment at Gemai\nwere faring no better.\nThose of us left at Gemai were to go up to\nKosheh by one of the first trains that could run over\nthe repaired line, so we looked out anxiously for\nnews of our people at Sarras, to hear how they were\ngetting on with the work. At last (8th of September)\nwe heard that they had finished it and that we were\nto go up by the next train from Halfa. Our limited\nkit was packed, all the tents were struck and stacked,\nand at 6 A.M. next morning, when the train steamed\nin, we thought our release had come. But no-the\ntrain was required to take up more stores to Kosheh.\nAll day, and the next, we were in this state of sus-\nspense. We found some shade under the mess\ntable, we had a soup-plate to wash our faces in, and\n"

It was then that we\nheard what we had been so long dreading: that\nthere would not be enough room on the boats for all\nthe regiment-for it had been known all along that\nwe Staffords were to go as far as possible in the\nboats-and that over a hundred men and a propor-\ntion of officers would have to be left at Kosheh.\nThe men left behind were selected from the\ndefaulters, worst shots, and one complete company :\nand the officers to remain with them were the\njunior captain, junior lieutenant, and junior second\nlieutenant.1\nDuring the morning of the 11th a loud report\nwas heard all over the camp and we thought that it\nwas some gun being tested on one of the boats.\nImagine our dismay when we heard that the boiler\nof the new gunboat, the Zafir-the pride of the fleet\n-had burst, rendering the boat perfectly useless\nuntil a new plate could be sent from Assouan! At\nfirst it was thought that all of our men who were to\nhave gone in her would have to remain behind as\nwell, but by means of some overcrowding a good\nnumber were stowed away on the other boats, and,\nin the end, only an additional half company was\nleft.\n1 Captain Astell, Lieutenant Andrus, and 2nd Lieutenant Wyatt.\n"

About 6 P.M. we passed\nDulgo (or Delligo), where the whole of the Egyptian\narmy had arrived in the morning from Absárat, and\nwe now saw them on the march to Kaderma, accom-\npanied by a caravan of camels about two miles\nlong.\nThe boats were moored up for the night at\nKaderma, near Kaibar, and we bivouacked near\nthem, facing the desert and the east, on the right of\nthe Egyptian army. We were now well in the\nenemy's country, and as every night after this was\nspent in a similar manner, we may as well give a\ndescription of the bivouac here. We all landed in\nfull \"marching order,\" soon after retreat, and slept\nin our clothes. Each man had a blanket, and no one\nwas allowed to take off his boots or putties. When\nvalises were at hand we used them as pillows,\notherwise one's coat folded up was a substitute.\nThe officers slept with their companies, and as a rule\nhad their dinner brought from the boat in a canteen.\nDuring the night there was, of course, a chain of out-\nposts round the camp, at a distance of about half a\nmile. At reveillé the bugle call of the Egyptian\narmy-one of the most musical of any was sounded\nat headquarters, and ran down the length of the lines,\nas one regiment after another took it up.

As\nsoon as all was reported clear, the staff officers rode\noff in different directions with their orders, and then\nthe regiments marched off to their different camping\ngrounds next to the boats. The latter were not\nused when moored up, as the space on board was so\nlimited. As there were no tents with the army,\nexcept those belonging to the staff and hospitals, the\ncamping-grounds were invariably situated under\ngroves of palm-trees. Where the latter did not\nafford sufficient protection from the sun, the men\nbrought their blankets into use, and by the end of\nthe campaign we were all adepts in constructing\nblanket-tents. A couple of blankets, three sticks,\nand a piece of string, made a shelter as shady as\nit was frail.\nWhilst bivouacking at Kaderma, we were sud-\ndenly aroused from our sleep in the dead of night\nby a tremendous babel of alarmed cries, shouted\norders, and the noise of a regular stampede away on\nour left; so, thinking the Dervishes were upon us,\nwe stood to arms. It turned out to be a false alarm\ncreated by some over-excited Egyptians. We\nnoticed especially the conduct of a Soudanese batta-\nlion on our right, which fell in at once without the\nslightest noise or confusion, in a manner that would\nhave done credit to any regiment in the world, for,\nin the total darkness, it was a trying moment.\nEarly on the 14th we steamed off and reached\nthe Kaibar Cataract before breakfast.

As for the\ncataract, it was not worthy of the name, not at high\nNile at any rate. It was very broken water, but a\nlittle careful steering soon surmounted the difficulty.\nAs each boat steamed through it became the object\nof vociferous cheering on the part of the 11th\nSoudanese, who lined the bank and were filling their\nwater-bottles. The \"three cheers\" were led by\ntheir bugler, who, after sounding the regimental call,\nfollowed it up with three \"G's\"!\nWe here noticed that the country on both sides\nshowed a marked change : there was more cultiva-\ntion and many more palms, and we could see that\nwe were well in the province of Dongola.

There was abundant evidence to\nshow that they had been here quite recently, such\nas bowls, zeers (earthenware filters), and the remains\nof fires. Fareig, like all the other villages which\nappear on the maps, was a collection of some twenty\nwretched mud hovels, and was situated in a grove\nof palm-trees which stretched along the river-bank\nfor several miles. During the morning the Sirdar\nand his staff arrived. The camp stretched for about\nfour miles along the river, and at the north end was\nthe Camel Corps' ground. The camels, with their\nbacks sore from overwork, were sickening to look\nat, and indeed it was well for the whole force that a\nprolonged halt was allowed here.\nOne regiment of blacks was bivouacking opposite\nthe spot where our boats were moored, so that we\nhad ample opportunity of studying them. They\nwere just like children, with their incessant chatter,\nand in their honest simplicity and love of fun. It\nwas as soldiers, however, that they were most\ninteresting. Never could one wish for a more ex-\ncellent set of men to lead into action. They love\nsoldiering, and when off parade amuse themselves\nin drilling each other.

They were jet black, and\ncame from all parts of the Soudan; in fact, some\nwere said to be reformed cannibals!

At Fareig the palms were to be\ncounted in hundreds, so that the material was\nnot wanting.\nOn the 15th a boat was seen about two miles\ndown the river, crowded with Dervishes, so the\nTamai, with companies of the Staffords and of the\n12th Soudanese on board, got up steam and went in\nchase. The Nordenfelt blazed away at them, but\nthey succeeded in effecting a landing on an island,\nand disappeared, leaving two boats behind, which\nwere towed triumphantly back, with one Dervish\nwho was taken prisoner.

To those\nwho have never gone into action a few details may\nbe of interest.

We reached\nthe fort at 6 A.M., and to our unutterable disgust we\nsaw that such was indeed the case. The fort was a\nlarge square building constructed entirely of mud,\nprotected by walls five feet high, which could have\nbeen levelled in a very short time, and surmounted\nby a double tier of loopholes. It was ascertained\nthat the enemy had abandoned Kerma during the\nnight, as soon as they heard of our approach, and\nhad crossed over in twenty-seven gyassas to Hafir,\non the left bank of the river.\nThe Dervish commander was Wad el Bishara, one\nof the Khalifa's most prominent Emirs. He was now\nthirty-two years of age, was a great favourite with\nthe Khalifa, and was given the command of Dongola\nin 1895. This manœuvre of Bishara's of crossing\nthe river on the eve of being attacked, was one of\nthe most masterly tactics ever practised in Soudan\nwarfare. By abandoning Kerma at the last moment,\nhe, at one stroke, rendered powerless the whole of\nthe Sirdar's force except the artillery and gunboats.\n"

When immediately opposite their\nposition, the Infantry Division halted and formed\nup along the river. Shells and bullets came whizzing\ntowards us, and one shell knocked a hole through a\nmud hut next to which a group of our men was\nposted, but no one was hurt.\nThere were only three gunboats in this action,\nnamely the Tamai (Commander Colville),¹ the Abu\nKlea(Lieutenant Beatty), and the Metemmeh (Captain\nOldfield).

One was posted near a sakieh\n(water-wheel) and the other in a dense group of\npalms. Between these two a double row of rifle\npits had been dug, from which a heavy fusilade was\nnow poured into the boats.\nThe sight was a remarkable one.

Presently their cavalry\nwas seen going at a smart trot across the open, and\nvery pretty they looked with their shining spears and\nwell-kept lines.\nAbout this time Commander Colville was wounded\nin the wrist, and the boats had to retire. En-\ncouraged by this momentary check, the Dervishes,\nsome of whom had begun to draw off, now returned\nand opened a heavy fire.

From the top of the\nlatter, a number of Dervish marksmen had been\nsteadily firing on to our decks, but the rockets found\nthem \"up a tree\" in every sense of the term, and it\nwas laughable to see them come scuttling down\nagain.\nAt 9 A.M. a passage was found from our bank to\na small island, called Antagashi Island, opposite the\nenemy's lines.

They began to\nwithdraw, and many, as they left the cover of their\ntrenches, were knocked over by the Maxims on the\ngunboats. The Dervish commander, Wad Bishara,\nwas wounded by a shell in two places, and, as he\nwas carried into a place of safety, he exclaimed,\n\"Allah is against me.\" He had just received a\nletter from the Khalifa, and had ordered all his\nattendants out of the tent, except one or two, when\nthe shell burst inside the tent and killed those with\nhim.\nThe boats now steamed full speed to Dongola,\nand our artillery soon afterwards silenced the\nenemy's guns; but rifle fire was going on at in-\ntervals throughout the day. Now that the boats\nwere gone, the Dervishes showed themselves more\nopenly, and shouted defiance at us. During the\nafternoon a mass of fugitives were seen flying south,\nand a fire was kept on them by the guns. We slept\nthat night on the position we had occupied during\nthe day, with the guns booming and the quick-firers\npeppering away at intervals until daybreak. The\ngyassas, in which the Dervish army had crossed the\nriver, were laden with all their grain and food, and\nall night long the enemy made frantic efforts to\nreach the spot where they were moored by the\nbank.

When day broke on the\n20th, Hafir was found to be evacuated.\nThe enemy's loss must have been considerable.\nAs they buried most of their dead in the manner\ndescribed above, it is hard to form an estimate, but\nprobably 200, at least, were killed. Wad Bishara\nwas severely wounded, as we have seen, and his\nnephew had his leg blown off. Many prisoners\nwere taken, including an Egyptian gunner who had\nbeen in Hicks's force. He said that he and the\nother gunners at Hafir were amicably inclined\ntowards us, but that the Baggara stood over them\nas they were working the guns, with drawn swords!\nThere seems to be some truth in their statement,\nfor several shells were sent off without fuses, in fact,\none of these was found in the magazine of the Abu\nKlea. What the consequences would have been if\nit had exploded it is impossible to say; but with one\nof our remaining steamers rendered hors de combat,\nthe day might not have ended quite so successfully.\nAs it was, all three gunboats were considerably\nknocked about; the Abu Klea, for instance, being\nhit 86 times. Twenty-seven gyassas, laden with\ngrain, were captured; 120 boxes of Nordenfelt\nammunition, which had been in Hicks's ill-fated\nexpedition, fell into our hands; and the Dervish\nsteamer El Tahira was sunk.\nThe losses on our side were slight.

The Dervishes had chosen their\nposition admirably for contesting the advance of the\nboats up the river; whether they showed as much\njudgment in abandoning the position as soon as the\nboats got past, is open to doubt.\nAt 6.30 on the morning of the 20th the force\nbegan the passage of the river in the captured\ngyassas, which had been emptied of their grain. We\nleft our bivouac at Kerma at 9 A.M., and by I P.M.\nhad taken up our quarters at Hafir, across the river.\nThe horses were the greatest difficulty, as there were\nvery few boats which would accommodate them; but\nthey too were all on the other side by sunset. About\n5 o'clock we saw the gunboats coming down stream\nas hard as they could, and they brought news that\nthey had bombarded Dongola, at 300 yards range,\nand had taken a lot of treasure and a few boats.\nWe found the gyassas waiting for us at Hafir, with\nour kits on board; they had been brought over the\ncataract the day before, and it was a great treat to\nget them again. Since we left the boats at Sadek\nwe had absolutely nothing except the clothes we stood\nin, so that the opportunity of getting at a pair of\nsocks, razor, and other luxuries was eagerly seized.\nK2\n"

During the morning the Sirdar\nreceived telegrams from her Majesty the Queen\nand the Khedive, congratulating him on the result\nof the fight.\nWe found time to visit the Dervish fortifications,\nwhich had been very much knocked about. The\ntrenches were filled with hundreds of cartridge cases,\nand bowls, bones, etc. -the remnants of hastily\nsnatched meals. The mud walls were about two\nfeet thick; and we found that the loopholes were so\nconstructed that men could only fire straight in front\nof them. Here was the El Tahira, one of Gordon's\nsteamers, a complete wreck on the bank, with the\nwhole of its starboard side under water. It was a\npaddle-wheel boat about forty feet long, of an antique\ntype. Along the bank were stored a number of cases\nof Dervish ammunition, including that above referred\nto belonging to Hicks.\n"

Before starting there was another\nmedical inspection, and forty more men were weeded\nout and conveyed the rest of the way to Dongola\non gyassas. It is interesting to note how our\nnumbers had gradually dwindled down; we left\nCairo 914 strong, and of these only 520 marched\ninto Dongola!

Often we\ncame across men who showed every inclination to\n\"give up,\" but who nevertheless stuck to it when\nreminded that they had to keep up the credit of the\nregiment. This is the spirit, the esprit de corps,\nwhich demands every endeavour to foster and\ndevelop, but which the \"composite\" battalions,\n\" universal \" helmets, and such-like innovations tend\nto destroy.\nWe went on until 10 P.M., when the battalion was\nhalted, and we were told to lie down on the ground\nand go to sleep. This bivouac was at a place called\nBeni, situated opposite the middle of Argo island.\nAll this we have learnt since, for we saw nothing\nbut a clump of palms; however, one name is as\ngood as another in these parts.\n،،\nThe next morning (the 22nd) we were off again\nat a quarter to five, and reached Zowerat at 10 A.M.\nThe camels had been left behind at Hafir, and our\nblankets had been stowed on an \"emergency \"\ngyassa, which we were told we should meet after a\nnine-mile march.\nEmergency\" forsooth!-it was\nnot until we reached Zowerat, having had no food\nfor nearly twenty-two hours, and having covered a\ndistance of twenty-two miles, that we found the\ngyassa waiting for us with our rations.

On our extreme left was the Nile, with the\nfour gunboats, including the Zafir, which had been\nrepaired at Kosheh, and had arrived at 3 A.M. this\nmorning, just in time. Marching by the river, on\nour left, was the 1st Brigade, and on our right was\nthe 2nd Brigade, each brigade having two Maxims\non the inner flank. Next came the 3rd Brigade,\nand further away to the right, where the vast desert\nplain rose up into a ridge, were the Cavalry, Horse\nArtillery, and Camel Corps. Behind us was the 4th\nBrigade in reserve.\nThe men of the Maxim battery wore their red\ncoats on this occasion, which lent additional colour\nto the scene. It was indeed one of the finest sights\nimaginable; the army of 15,000 whites, Arabs, and\nblacks, the largest force under an English general\nsince the days of the Crimea; the whole tramping\non and on, company after company, and regiment\nafter regiment. We may reasonably conclude that\nthe Dervishes were still more impressed with the\nsight, and we heartily regretted that our force was\nof such imposing dimensions, for we were half\nafraid that at the sight of our numbers the Dervishes\nwould bolt.\nThe boats went on ahead, and about seven o'clock\ntheir guns told us they were engaging the enemy,\nwho were as yet invisible to us.

As we did so the enemy fell back; plucky\nand fanatical as they were, they were not disposed\nto be slaughtered wholesale just yet. It transpired\nlater that they had had a council of war the previous\nnight, in which some were for retiring and some for\nwaiting to see if our strength was as great as it was\nrepresented to be. Bishara had gone off on a\ncamel early in the morning, having got more than\nhe bargained for at Hafir.\nMeanwhile the gunboats were dropping shell after\nshell amongst the enemy, and as the latter had\nthought themselves out of range from the river this\ndisconcerted them considerably. Their retreat\nbecame more and more precipitate, and they even\nthrew away their arms and ammunition. The\ncavalry thereupon pushed forward after them; but\nthe Dervishes only gave one opportunity for a\ncharge, which was led by Captain Adams\n(Scots Greys). He charged the Dervish leader,\nthey collided, and came to the ground, but neither\nwere injured, and the Emir was taken prisoner.\nEighteen Baggara were killed, and on our side one\ncavalry officer and six men were wounded.\nOn we went, and as we had to keep up with the\nMaxims on our flanks it was more a run than a\nmarch.

Their white jibbas had\nmade them a conspicuous object from the boats.\nEvery now and then a Dervish would spring up\nfrom amongst some bushes where they had been\nconcealed, and the scouts in front disposed of them.\nBut most of the enemy had no fight left in them,\nin token of which they advanced holding up both\nhands over the head, and indicating by every means\nin their power that they were peaceably inclined.\nIt was a ticklish moment for these fugitives,\nadvancing alone towards us, and they probably did\nnot feel at ease until they had finished their\nexamination before the Intelligence Staff. Some\nof the Baggara who were routed out of the scrub\nresisted desperately; and as they persisted in assur-\ning us that Allah was on their side, and by way of\nemphasis, attempted to demonstrate the fact on\ntheir hearers, there was no alternative but to put\nthem hors de combat.\nThe mud huts of Dame were the scenes of several\nexciting incidents. A couple of our scouts, seeing\na horse saddled and bridled waiting outside one of\nthem, entered cautiously to see if they could discover\nthe owner, when out darted a gigantic Dervish,\nsprang on the horse, and was away like the wind,\nwith a defiant yell. He was too sanguine, however,\nfor up went half a dozen rifles-ping, ping, and he\nwas bowled over, falling backwards off his horse,\nwhich went careering madly up and down the line\nuntil it was eventually secured by one of the special\n"

For many of those who were\nnot restrained by the rigid bond of discipline,\nthese huts afforded excellent looting ground, and\nsome valuable articles were picked up here. One\nman in particular had a narrow escape. He was\nforaging about on the look out for loot, and entered\na hut; his servant remaining outside and holding\nhis horse. Suddenly out of the hut rushed\nDervish, shot the man's servant dead on the spot,\nand rode off on the horse, leaving its owner flabber-\ngasted.\na\nBy 11.30 A.M. the enemy were in full retreat, and\nwe (Staffords) were absolutely done up. For seven\nhours we had been almost running, without a pause,\ntrying to keep up with the guns. We had long since\nfinished our water bottles, and there was a whole\nbrigade between us and the Nile. At last we\nreached a pool of sluggish water, and nature could\nstand no more. The regiment halted and all filled\ntheir water bottles, whilst the black regiments\nmarched on, looking as fit as when they started.\nBut then their water bottles were half as large again\nas ours, and they were marching on their native soil\nand as much accustomed to desert marches as we\nwere to macadamised roads. Another advantage\nwhich the Egyptians possessed was that they were\nspecially trained to do without drink, which can\nhardly be said of English soldiers. However, British\npersistence had prevailed, and every man had kept\non as long as there was any prospect of being\nrequired to fight.\n"
"140\nPART II\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nWe should be wasting this opportunity if we\nneglected to emphasise the urgent necessity of\nsupplying our troops, especially those employed in\nthe arduous desert work of such countries as Egypt,\nwith a larger water bottle than that which is now\nissued to them. Some of the articles in the Press\nsaid that some arrangement should have been made\nfor a supply of water to be carried on camels; but it\nis easy to be wise after the event, and no one knew\nwhen we started that we were in for a seven hours'\ndesert march beyond the reach of water.\nAs we went on, numbers of wounded Dervishes\nwere brought in, carried either by relief parties or on\ndonkeys, and some of their wounds were simply\nghastly. One poor fellow had his foot cut clean off\nby a cavalry sabre-but these are not pleasant details\nto dwell upon. We saw a number of banner poles\nlying about; but the banners had, in nearly every\ncase, been stripped off by the enemy. After passing\nthe Dervish quarter of Dongola, and the old\nEuropean quarter, the whole force halted by the\nriver, with the exception of the mounted troops, who\ncontinued the pursuit.\nBefore noon the Egyptian crescent and star\nfloated on the walls of Dongola, being hoisted on\nthe Mudir's house by Commander Colville, who\nhad landed, unopposed, with a party from the boats.\nThe Sirdar sent a telegram to her Majesty,\nannouncing the capture of Dongola, and at the\nsame time sending her the congratulations of the\nforce on the length of her reign to-day.\n"
"CHAP. X\n141\nTHE CAPTURE OF DONGOLA\nThe pursuit of the flying Dervishes was main-\ntained by the cavalry and camelry till late in the\nafternoon. They had taken to the desert with their\nwives and children, but finding the pursuit getting\ntoo close they evidently came to the conclusion that\nchildren were luxuries that might be dispensed with,\nso they deposited them on the sand; and these were\nlater on collected and brought into camp in an\nartillery waggon!\nThe result of the day's work was, on our side,\ntwenty-eight Egyptians wounded, including one\ncavalry officer. There were no casualties amongst\nthe British troops. It is practically impossible to\ndetermine the number of Dervishes killed, as they\ncarried off as many as they could with them, but\nthe number was probably not very considerable.\nEighteen Baggara were killed by Captain Adams'\ntroop, and 900 prisoners were taken, as well as six\nguns, a large quantity of ammunition and grain, and\nthree immense date \"granaries.\" One of the\nprisoners was Hassan Nejumi, cousin of the Jaalin\nleader of that name who was defeated and killed\nat Toski.\nThe Staffords bivouacked, not by the river, but\nby a sluggish piece of backwater, which the prin-\ncipal medical officer, immediately on our arrival,\ndeclared to be absolutely poisonous; but the men\nwere quite incapable of marching another yard, so\nthey had to drink it or walk a mile. As it was, a\ngood many drank a quantity of it, with the result\nthat over twenty died of fever shortly afterwards.\n"
"142\nPART II\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nTruly the question of water-supply is by far the\nmost important of any in Soudan warfare.\nWhen night came on, the \"emergency\" gyassa\nwas found to have gone astray, so again no blankets\nwere forthcoming. This, however, was a detail to\nwhich we were accustomed by this time, and was\ncompensated for by the deep sense of relief which\nwe felt at our labours being practically over.\n"

The\nEnglish were last here on the 5th of July, 1885,\nand on the 17th of August Abdul Majid el Kalik,\nacting under Mohamed el Khair, with 3,000 Der-\nvishes, took possession of the place. In a few years\nthe whole province was utterly ruined.

These buildings\nwere once a post-office, barracks, and the residence\nof the Mudir (local governor). To-day they were\nsheltering some of the Egyptian regiments from the\nintense heat of the noon day sun. A mile north of this\nbrought us to the quarter of Dongola inhabited by\nthe Arabs in 1884. This was now nothing but a heap\nof ruins, the Dervishes having destroyed the place\nfrom sanitary considerations, for after a time these\nnative huts become too filthy to live in.

We felt that words like these, coming from\nsuch a thorough soldier as Sir Herbert Kitchener,\nwent far to compensate us for our recent experi-\nences.\nIn our new camping ground we were as much in\na state of squalor as ever, except that the gyassa\nwith the blankets and kits at last made its appear-\nance, and we were able to eat with a fork off a tin\nplate, instead of with a pocket-knife out of the tin.\nOf course, tents were absolutely unknown, except\nthose of the Headquarters and Hospital, all the\nothers being left at Kosheh, and the only shelter\nfrom the sun we ever had was such as we could\nimprovise with blankets, bushes and rifles. The\nDervish spears which we got here came in very\nuseful for this purpose. Apropos of this, we read\nin the papers that \"it was a pleasant sight to see the\nEnglish officers giving up their tents to the wounded\nDervishes, and sitting in the sun whilst the latter\nwere having their wounds dressed.\" It made us\nangry to read such nonsense, but we were not by\nany means surprised, after the astounding statements\nwe had already seen in print. Of course, the enemy\nwere attended to in our hospital with as much care\nas our own wounded received, and the medical staff\nwere always kept pretty busy.\nOne afternoon there was an auction of Dervish\ntrophies - spears, guns, jibbahs (tunics), saddles,\nnagara (war-drums), cartridge-belts, &c.

Like every one else,\nthey were walking about camp on the look-out for\nDervish curios of any kind, when they saw a\nwounded Dervish being carried by his comrades\ntowards the hospital, on an angareeb (native bed-\nstead), with some guns lying next to him on the\nbed. Thinking the guns were Dervish (they were\nRemingtons, with which many Dervishes were\narmed) they offered money for them. To their\nsurprise the Dervishes declined to accept payment,\nbut pressed them to take the weapons gratis, which,\nneedless to say, they did. No sooner had they put\nthem away in their tent-or rather blanket-shelter-\nthan up rushed half-a-dozen Egyptian soldiers, who\nloudly clamoured for their rifles!\nIt turned out\nthat the rifles belonged to a 'Gyppy escort, who had\nleft their charge for a few minutes.

We left Dongola on the\n26th of September in the gunboats, the men being\ntowed in gyassas. Whereas our progress up stream\nhad only averaged four miles an hour, we now went\nat the rate of twelve, which gives an idea of the\nstrength of the current. We stopped at Kerma\nfor a couple of hours to lay a cable across the river\nto Hafir, thereby putting Dongola in telegraphic\ncommunication with the rest of the world. We\nlanded again at Hannek, whilst the two steamers\nwent to see if they could pull the El Teb off the\nrock on which she had stuck before the battle of\nHafir; but after trying in vain for several hours\nthey had to abandon the attempt. We watched\ntheir efforts from the shore, where we had got\nunder what shelter we could find from the broiling\nsun.\nHere we spent most of the day, living in an\natmosphere of stench which it is impossible to\ndescribe, for the spot where we were halted was\na few hundred yards to the leeward side of a large\nheap of dead camels. It made us feel perfectly\nsick, and brandy and tobacco were in great request.\nWe marched north about five o'clock, the idea being\nthat the boats should pass through the Third Cataract,\n1\n"

But no\ntouch was kept with the boats, so that at nightfall\nwe had to lie down as we were, and sleep until day-\nlight revealed their whereabouts. This time we\nhad not even our havresacks for pillows, so used\nour helmets instead. At daybreak we marched\nanother three miles, and then found the boats.\nThis march was the most repulsive one of the\nwhole campaign, for all the way the desert was\nstrewn with the bodies of camels, and in one place\nalone we saw fourteen carcasses. It brought to our\nminds one of the songs of our camp-life at Gemai,\nof which the chorus (with apologies to Kipling) ran :\n\"On the road to Dongolay,\nWhere the dying camels lay,\nAnd the sun comes down like hell-fire,\nAnd grows hotter day by day.\"\nEarly on the 29th the boats landed us at Kosheh,\nand we entrained at once for Wady Halfa.

The experience of being\nsquashed in a truck with thirty men-with one leg\nwedged between tents and kit-bags, and the other\nhanging over the side of the truck-was unique, but\ncertainly not enjoyable!

We spent four days at\nAssouan, to allow time for the many sick which we\nwere bringing down with us (including Colville) to\nbe transported round the Cataract without undue\nhaste. We found time to pay a visit to Philae;\nand left Assouan on the 5th, in Cook's Nile\nsteamers Nefert-Ari and Tewfik. The latter was\nalmost entirely given over to the hospital patients,\nwho were increasing in number daily. Now that\nall the excitement was over, a reaction had set in,\nand the fever, which had hitherto been flickering,\nbroke out with increased vigour.\nSoon after leaving Luxor, our Sergeant-major\n(Cunningham) died of enteric fever contracted at\nDongola-after filling his office most capably through-\nout the campaign-and was buried at Assiut. We will\ndescribe the funeral, for it was quite the most re-\nmarkable of the many we have seen. Slowly and\nmournfully the procession started from the boat,\nuntil a native told them that the cemetery was five\nmiles out in the desert, whereupon the pace\nquickened to one of startling rapidity.

They were pursued for a considerable\ndistance by our cavalry and camelry, who killed a\ngood many, and took 900 prisoners.

"\n158\nT\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nCHAP. I\nPART III\nof the first steps was to establish courts of justice,\nand a system of police. The Egyptian troops were\nemployed in rebuilding the town of Dongola on its\nold site. The railway, the greatest of the civilising\nagents in Africa, was at once continued southward\ntowards Kerma, whence steamboats have open\nwater up to the Fourth Cataract (Merawi). The\nlatter place now became the headquarters of the\narmy. By the end of the year (1896) the line\nreached Kerma, which became the southern ter-\nminus.\nAlthough Dongola was by far the most fertile\nprovince in Upper Nubia, it had been allowed by\nits wretched inhabitants to go almost out of cultiva-\ntion, and to relapse into desert. They had preferred\nto remain idle rather than sow for the Dervish to\nreap, and had only cultivated little patches sufficient\nfor their own use. Now, under the new order of\nthings, they not only provide for their own use, but\ncultivate large areas for export purposes. The\nprovince has been opened to commerce, and will,\nno doubt, ere long regain its former importance as\na commercial centre. Before its evacuation in\n1885, a large trade was carried on, chiefly in gum,\ngold-dust, and ivory, which were exchanged for\nManchester goods.\nIt is a remarkable fact that all the trade, which\nhas been revived here by the British and Egyptians,\nis now exclusively in the hands of Greeks.\nThe troops had scarcely time to encamp anywhere\nin the reconquered country, before a crowd of\n1\nGreeks arriv\nup their stal\nare surprise\nlittle attenti\nEgyptians t\nunder the\nmiles of terr\nand here is 1\nfor new ma\nwhilst this e\ntrade in Afri\nthe Greek co\nEgyptians ha\nThe Egyp\nClinton Daw\nend of 1896\ncondition of\nreport are in\n\"A comparison\nof 1885, the last\ntrustworthy, illu\nprovince during\nconsidered under\nand it may be c\nthese heads as th\nbe taken to have\nabout 47,000 are\nArabs.

"CHAP. I\n159\nTHE CAPTURE OF ABU HAMED\nGreeks arrived with their camels and goods, set\nup their stalls, and established their business. We\nare surprised that this subject has attracted SO\nlittle attention. Here are the English and the\nEgyptians toiling with the sweat of their brows\nunder the desert sun, and bringing hundreds of\nmiles of territory back to civilisation and commerce,\nand here is England looking out all over the world\nfor new markets where she can send her goods;\nwhilst this excellent opportunity of developing her\ntrade in Africa is allowed to quietly slip away, and\nthe Greek coolly monopolises what the British and\nEgyptians have acquired!\nThe Egyptian Under-Secretary for Finance, Mr.\nClinton Dawkins, was sent up to Dongola at the\nend of 1896 to enquire into and report upon the\ncondition of the province. The salient facts of his\nreport are interesting. He says :-\n\"A comparison of the information now collected with the statistics\nof 1885, the last year for which there exists statistics more or less\ntrustworthy, illustrates the changes that have taken place in the\nprovince during the period of Dervish rule. These changes can be\nconsidered under the heads of population, cultivation, cattle, and trade,\nand it may be convenient to make specific recommendations under\nthese heads as they are discussed in turn. The population in 1885 may\nbe taken to have been 75,000. It now amounts to 56,426, of whom\nabout 47,000 are natives of the province, the rest being Soudanese and\nArabs. About 6,000 men are also reported to be absent from the\nprovince either in the Soudan or in Egypt, some 3,000 of whom are\nliving in Wady Halfa, and the excess of the female over the male\npopulation is striking. The decrease of the population and the general\nimpoverishment of the province date in a large part from 1888, when\nan unusually low Nile accompanied by cattle disease resulted in\nactual famine. The expedition of Wad-el-Nejumi in the following\nyear was another calamity. Many of the inhabitants either followed,\nor were compelled to follow, the Dervish leader in his disastrous un-\n"
"160\nPART III\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\ndertaking, and the cattle were swept up for his commissariat. The\nfirst requisite of the province is population and able-bodied population.\nThe excess of female over male population has already been noticed,\nand the male population itself largely consists of old men and children.\nA few of the refugees to Egypt are returning, but the greater number\nhang back, and there is no rush among the Dongolawis as yet to\nresume possession of their old homes.\n\"If the statistics for 1885 are correct, and the 6,451 sakiehs (water-\nwheels) were in full working order each with a complement of three\npairs of animals, there must have been some 36,000 cattle in the pro-\nvince at that time devoted exclusively to irrigation. The number\nof cattle is now under 12,000.\"\nOn the subjects of taxation and proprietary rights,\nMr. Dawkins says :-\n...\n\"The principal taxes under the old régime were the saquia tax and\nthe date-palm tax. Minor taxes also existed, such as the pasturage\ntax, professional tax, Beduin tribute, house duty, and boat tax. The\nsaquia and date tax amounted together to about £E52,000; the re-\nmaining taxes brought in about ₤E2,000. Some of these have been\nabolished in Egypt, and with a simple administration such as the\nprovince can support, it would be well to limit locally-collected taxa-\ntion to as few articles as possible. The Dervishes took no dues\nbeyond the saquia tax and date tax. It would be wise to follow their\nexample for the present at any rate.\nThe Dervishes to some\nextent modified the Government system by attempting a rough classi-\nfication of the areas served by a water-wheel according to their yield,\ninstead of levying an invariable rate. In doing this they followed\nthe general principle of Mohammedan taxation. They calculated the\nyield of each area, and took nominally a tenth in kind of each crop\ngrown on it. Tax receipts were given, but the tenth was calculated\nin favour of the Dervish treasury. From inquiries made, it would\nappear that the money value of the tax they actually collected, not of\nthe nominal tenth, works out at nearly sixty piastres per feddan, (acre)\nmuch the same as the former Government rate that existed immedi-\nately before the evacuation.\n\"The cultivators who remained on the arrival of the Dervishes in\n1885 were not disturbed in the holdings, and occasional voluntary\nsales took place under Dervish rule. These sales should be recognised,\nand the titles of all individuals, or their heirs, now on the land whose\nnames correspond with the entries in the old tax-registers, should be\nconfirmed in possession.\"\n"
"CHAP. I\n161\nTHE CAPTURE OF ABU HAMED\nThe large decrease of the population since the\nabandonment of the Soudan, as shown by the above\nreport, speaks volumes for the evil effects of the\nKhalifa's rule, especially when it is remembered that\nDongola was the most remote of his provinces,\nand furthest removed from the oppression of the\nBaggara.\nWhilst the pacification of Dongola was pro-\ngressing, the Khalifa was uneasily contemplating\nthe situation in Omdurman, which he took\nfurther measures to render in a state of defence.\nHe gathered all his available forces in Omdurman,\nwhere they might have remained until the Sirdar's\nnext forward movement, were it not for an un-\nexpected occurrence the revolt of the Jaalin tribe.\nThis tribe, which had only served the Khalifa under\nthe terrorism of the Baggara, now openly pro-\nclaimed their independence. The chief town of\ntheir district is Metemmeh, which they placed in a\nstate of defence.\nIn June, 1897, the Khalifa sent out Mahmud, his\nnephew and principal general, with a large force,\nagainst the Jaalins, and on the 1st of July Mahmud\narrived before Metemmeh. Abdulla Wad Saad,\nthe Jaalin leader, had stationed the few men armed\nwith rifles whom he had with him in the forts on\nthe south side of the village, entrusting the defence\nof the other sides to the rest of his forces, armed\nonly with swords and spears. The Dervishes\ndirected their first attacks against the south front,\nfrom which they were, however, repulsed with loss.\nM\n"
"162\nPART III\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nThey then turned their efforts against the north side\nof the village, where a portion of them eventually\nsucceeded in effecting an entrance. Here Abdulla\nWad Saad and his garrison were hemmed in and\ncut to pieces, the total loss of the Jaalins being\nestimated at 2,000 killed. The Dervishes, though\ngreatly outnumbering their adversaries, also suffered\nsevere loss. It is a great pity, as far as the un-\nfortunate Jaalins are concerned, that they did not\ncurb their impatience, and hold themselves in\nreadiness until the Sirdar could have joined hands\nwith them. The revolt of the Jaalins was only\none of the many signs that the Dervish bubble had\nburst.\nThe Sirdar's policy of advancing slowly and\ndeliberately, and at each step consolidating the\npower of the Egyptian Government, was continued\nin 1897, and the work of getting up stores to the\nposts along the Nile, on the Merawi-Debbeh\nfrontier, was proceeded with.\nFrom Abu Fatmeh (and Kerma, the railway\nterminus), just above the Third Cataract, an un-\nbroken stretch of 220 miles of navigation extends\nthrough the entire province of Dongola, as far as its\nboundary, Debbeh, and on into the next province of\nShagiyeh, up to Merawi, at the foot of the Fourth\nCataract.\nDebbeh formerly marked the boundary between\nthe Dongolawi (or Danagla) - Nubians, the natives\nof Dongola-and the Shagiyeh Arabs.

The 11th Soudanese\nwere on the right, then the 3rd Regiment, then the\n9th Soudanese, and the 10th Soudanese were on\nthe left.

The loss of\nSidney and FitzClarence came as a blow to the\nwhole Egyptian army and to all connected with it.\nMajor Sidney was conspicuous for his military\nability, and was positively worshipped by his men of\nthe 10th Battalion. Poor FitzClarence was as\nkeen a soldier as ever lived. When, in March,\nhe started for the front (from Cairo, where he had\nbeen on leave) he told the writer, who went to\nwish him good-bye, that he was half afraid he\nwouldn't come in for the next big fight, as he\nwould probably be stationed at Assouan. But Fate\nruled otherwise!\nIn the assault of the town, the discipline of the\ntroops was especially marked; and the Egyptians\nand Soudanese seemed to vie with each other as to\nwho could show the greatest steadiness and dash.\nThe march from Merawi to Abu Hamed was\nthrough difficult and barren country, and had\nGeneral Hunter's troops been defeated, there would\nhave been few left to return.\nWhilst Hunter was marching on Abu Hamed, a\nstrong patrol of the Camel Corps was sent from\nMerawi, under Brevet-Major Tudway, to Gakdul, to\nhold in check the Dervish force at Metemmeh; and\nat the same time the gunboats were sent across the\nthe Fourth Cataract, or rather the fourth series of\ncataracts, which extend over sixty miles of river.\nThe Nile is here more obstructed than in any other\nportion of its course, and the river is filled with\n"
"168\nPART III\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nmasses of rock of every shape and size. Sir\nWilliam Butler, who in the Nile Expedition of\n1885 superintended the boat service over these\nrapids, thus describes this region :-\n\"No wilder scene can be imagined than this waste called Dar\nMonassir. For miles together there is no vestige of vegetation ;\nsilence is broken only by the noise of the foaming waters; the rocks\nleft bare by the subsiding current, and black and polished by sand and\nsun; whenever it is possible to climb one of the rugged hills on either\nshore, the eye ranges only over a wilder area of desolation, burnt and\ncindery rocks rise up in every direction, from amid wastes of sand.\nAt times the channels of the river are so sunken beneath the level of\nthe granite wilderness around, that they are perfectly hidden from sight\nat only a short distance from the shore. At intervals the islands dis-\nappear, the river flows gently in a single stream between shores of\nblack granite, as though its waters were resting between the cataract\nbehind and the next in front; but these bits of comparatively smooth\nwater are few, and taking the entire stream from the Fourth Cataract\nat Owli to the head of the island of Sherri, a distance of about sixty\nmiles of water, there cannot be less than twenty-five miles of actual\ncataract. Up to a recent period, in fact up to the boat expedition of\n1884-5, little or nothing was known about these cataracts of Monassir.\nThis was owing to the fact that they had always been avoided by\ntravellers passing between Egypt and the Soudan; the caravans in-\nvariably quitting the Nile at Korti, and striking it again across the\nBayouda at Metemmeh or Berber.\"\nBetween Abu Hamed and Berber, a distance of\n130 miles, there are only two cataracts, the Shellal\nel Baggarah (\"The Rapid of the Cows\") and the\nShellal el Umar (\"The Rapid of the Asses\"). The\nlatter is known as the Fifth Cataract.\nThe passage of the gunboats over the Fourth\nCataract was superintended by Captain Colin\nKeppel, R.N., assisted by Lieutenants Hood and\nBeatty, R.N., and Captains Fitton, Stanton, and\nBainbridge (Egyptian army). With the exception\nof the El Teb, which capsized, all the gunboats\n"

On the same day (6th) two gun-\nboats were despatched to Ed Damer, a place of\nconsiderable strategical value, a few miles beyond\nthe junction of the Nile and Atbara. Here the\nEmir Zeki had arrived with\nDervish force,\non his retreat from Berber. Some shots were ex-\nchanged, and Zeki retired inland, leaving behind\nfourteen large boats laden with grain, which were\ncaptured by the gunboats, and taken to Berber.\nOn the 13th of September General Hunter en-\ntered Berber with the greater part of the Egyptian\narmy.\na\nEd Damer was occupied, a fort was erected at the\njunction of the two rivers called Fort Atbara, and\nhalf a battalion, under Lieutenant Wolseley(Cheshire\nRegiment, Egyptian army) was sent to hold the\nplace.

Besides the latter there were more than\nthat number of women, double the number of\nchildren, and immense drives of cattle, camels,\ngoats and sheep. The approach of the Egyptian\narmy, added to the increasing hostility of the\nsurrounding tribes, made Osman think it was time\nto retire, and on the 23rd of September he began his\ndeparture, crossing the river at Guidi. He had only\none large boat and six \"dug-outs\"-trunks of trees\nhollowed out-and the passage of the river took him\na whole month. His followers and the camels were\ntaken across in the boats and on roughly constructed\nrafts, and the cattle by means of bladders fastened\nunder the throat. Osman completed his tedious\nundertaking only two days before General Hunter\nentered Adarama.\nIt had been Hunter's desire to push on to Adarama\nat once with his brigade, and take Osman at a\ndisadvantage, but the transport and supplies had not\narrived from Abu Hamed, so the opportunity was\nlost; and it was not until the 23rd of October that\nthe column left Berber, taking with them twelve\ndays' forage and rations.

All the boats used\nby Osman Digna had been sunk, and the \"dug-outs\"\nsmashed. No sign of the recent Dervish occupation,\nother than the abandoned angareebs (bedsteads) was\nvisible. A convoy of stores was captured, which\nhad been smuggled through from Sinkat, and had\nbeen intended for the personal use of Osman and his\nhousehold. This acquisition came in useful for\nfeeding the 5,000 starving women and children of\nthe unfortunate Jaalin tribe, in Berber. When,\nin the preceding July, the men of this tribe\nwere ruthlessly put to the sword by the Der-\nvishes, at Metemmeh, all the girls were carried\noff for the Baggaras' harems, and the old women\nand children-when not thrown into the river-\nhad been left to starve.\nThe country around the Atbara river was found\nto be very fertile and capable of growing almost any-\nthing, so that with proper husbandry and a peaceful\ngovernment it might be made a flourishing province.\nThe climate is excellent, though a comparatively\nheavy rainfall descends in this region.

Half\na dozen war correspondents also crossed, and, as a\nresult of their journey, seemed convinced that a\nrailway from Suakin to Berber would be im-\npracticable; for in consequence of the very rough\nand mountainous district which the line would have\nto traverse, the undertaking, they said, would never\npay for the outlay.\n"

Whether he imagined it\ngood tactics to permit the Sirdar to leisurely\ncomplete all his arrangements and to take all the\nposts he desired, and only to resist him at Metemmeh\nand Omdurman-or whether he meant to make\nsure of a large following with which to retire to\nKordofan or Darfur- it is impossible to conjecture;\nbut this is certain, that up to this time no really\ndetermined effort had been made by the Khalifa to\nresist the Egyptian advance.\nMahmud was a young man of fine physique ;\nbut latterly he had been giving himself up to\nexcesses, and had been drinking heavily. He\nhad recently raided-or had permitted his men\nto raid-Osman Digna's district, and had carried\noff a number of women; with the result that a\nbitter feud now existed between these Dervish\nEmirs, and Osman refused to have anything\nto do with Mahmud, and dared not go near\nMetemmeh. Mahmud, from what can be ascertained,\nused every artifice to induce the Khalifa to send him\nsupplies to enable him to move forward, but in vain.\nOn the other hand, the Khalifa endeavoured to\npersuade Mahmud to fall back with his large force\nto Omdurman, but this did not suit Mahmud's\n"

Thus it will be seen that a singular lack of\ncohesion and unanimity had sprung up amongst the\nDervish leaders-news of which reached the Sirdar\nin due course, to the latter's very considerable\nsatisfaction.\nMetemmeh was fortified, but it was well-known to\nColonel Wingate (Director of Intelligence) that its\noccupants were not in a position to hold out for any\nlength of time, owing to the scarcity of food. The\nKhalifa had, up to now (October), sent supplies\nfrom Omdurman to Metemmeh by boat, as being\nthe easier and quicker route: but the Sirdar now\ndecided to send up the gunboats and capture the\nenemy's nuggars and gyassas.\nOn the 15th of October the three gunboats Zafir,\nFatteh, and Nazir steamed away from Berber to\nreconnoitre the enemy's position at Metemmeh.\nWe have already described the Zafir.¹ The two\nothers arrived from England soon after the capture\nof Dongola, and were built on exactly the same\npattern as the first-named. The Zafir was now\ncommanded by Captain Colin Keppel, R.N. (who\ncommanded the flotilla), whilst the Nazir and Fatteh\nwere under Lieutenants Hood, R.N., and Beatty,\nR. N., respectively. In addition to its small native\ncrew and a couple of European engineers, each boat\non the present occasion carried fifty men of the\n9th Soudanese, and a couple of sergeants of the\nRoyal Marine Artillery.\n1 Part II. page 107.\n"
"176\nPART III\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nSoon after daybreak, on the 16th, the steamers\narrived a few miles north of Shendy without having\nmet with any opposition. They now saw the first\nsigns of the enemy. Two saddled horses were\ngrazing near the water's edge, and their owners\nwere sleeping so soundly on the bank that the boats\nhad quietly steamed up before they woke. That\nthey looked aghast, when, with their waking eyes,\nthey saw the three steamers in front of them, is but\nnatural; but the Maxim quickly brought them to\ntheir senses, and killed one, whilst the other\nescaped into the bush.\nShendy, which lies on the right bank of the Nile,\nwas passed, but was found to be in ruins. A few\nshots were fired from the boats, but evoked no\nresponse. Metemmeh was sighted half an hour after-\nwards. It is a large mud-built city of the ordinary\ntype, though perhaps not so straggling as the\nusual Soudanese town. It stands a thousand yards\nfrom the river, and the approach to it was guarded\nby seven substantial mud forts, with immensely\nthick solid walls, which were situated close to\nthe river's edge, and extended over a couple of\nmiles.\n\"Approaching the position, but keeping, of\nnecessity, outside the islands and close to the further\nbank, the flagship gave the signal to form and advance\nin quarter line, the Zafir leading with the Nazir\nfollowing.

The ships from a range of nearly\n4,000 yards now opened fire simultaneously on the\ntwo nearest works, and soon got the range of these\nfortifications to a nicety, the Marine Artillery\nsergeants and the native gunners making splendid\npractice. A stream of bullets turned on from the\nMaxim caught two of the Baggara horsemen, who\nwere galloping about the plain, while the rest\nscampered off to the hills precipitately. These\nBaggara were the only men to be seen in range,\nthough on the distant ridge a Dervish army had\ncongregated from its camp in the rear to watch\nthe operations. The Dervish gunners replied\nimmediately the ships opened fire, but owing to the\ninferiority of their old brass weapons their shells\nfell very short, and, though they burst well enough,\nthe only ones that travelled as far as the ships\nwere practically ricochets or those of a high angle\nfire, which went over the gunboats without doing\nmuch damage. One shell, however, fell on the\nZafir, and, severing a water-pipe and passing\nthrough the deck, mortally wounded a Soudanese.\nA shrapnel also burst over the Fatteh, and a 7 lb.\ncommon shell tore through the awning and smashed\nthe pole supporting it. After about an hour's long-\nrange fire the fleet moved up opposite to the posi-\ntion, pouring shell, shrapnel, and double shell into\nany place in which the enemy was supposed to\nbe.

As the gunboats passed\nthe forts it was discovered that the embrasures of\nthese erections only commanded the northern\napproach, and that when once in the rear of a fort\nthe vessels enjoyed an immunity from its fire. This\ndiscovery simplified matters considerably. While\nthe gunboats were hugging the east bank a sharp\nlook-out was fortunately kept along it for any\ntraces of the enemy, for when approaching the\nvicinity of some mimosa scrub and bushes a sharp\nfire from some twenty or thirty rifles was opened on\nthe vessels from the short range of about 100 yards.\nNo one on board was hit, though the bullets rattled\nabout the ship, and narrow escapes were many. A\ncouple of volleys and a raking Maxim fire from the\nFatteh at once silenced these sharpshooters, who\njumped up and fled into the thick scrub, leaving\nmany of their number dead behind them. The three\nvessels now steamed slowly past the town, and then,\nslewing round, retired down stream, still shelling\nthe enemy's position. At about half-past two o'clock\nfire ceased, and the gunboats were returning down\nthe river, when, rounding a slight bend, they came\nacross a number of Dervishes busily engaged in\nunloading some half-dozen nuggars which contained\nhorses, donkeys, many household effects, grain, and\nSome of the Dervishes, in their anxiety to\nsave as much of their goods as possible, miscalculated\nthe pace at which gunboats travel and stayed too\nlong, three of them being caught by the Maxim\nscents.\n"

The gunboats\nproceeded with the nuggars to an island six miles\nnorth of Metemmeh, and there remained for the\nnight.\n\"On the morning of the 17th of October the gun-\nboats started off again at a little after four o'clock\nso as to get into position opposite Metemmeh before\ndaylight, and on their arrival at once opened fire on\nthe forts, the Dervish guns, of which there were\nnine now instead of only seven, replying without\na moment's hesitation. It seems that on the pre-\nvious day Mahmud, fearing a land attack from the\ndirection of the Gakdul Wells, had erected batteries\nin the desert to protect that flank, and several guns\nhad been withdrawn from these during the night to\nstrengthen the forts along the river. Each of the\ntwo advanced forts now carried two guns. The\nDervish fire was infinitely more accurate than on\nthe previous day, but the shells still fell short, for\nthe vessels took care to keep out of their range,\nwhere they themselves could shell the forts unmerci-\nfully. Numbers of those making up the large\nDervish gathering, which stretched away for miles,\nwere mounted, and magnificent-looking men they\nwere. A few shrapnel shells fired at a venture from\nthe boats came quite unexpectedly among them, and\ncaused them to retire to the rear of the hills, behind\nwhich, in the desert, they had their fighting camp.\nThe same tactics as on the previous day were carried\nout by the gunboats, and after a few hours' shelling\nN2\n"

The forts, instead\nof slackening off their fire as on the previous day,\nnow redoubled their energies, and continued firing\nshell after shell in the most exultant but needless\nmanner long after the vessels had passed beyond\ntheir range. Then an extraordinary scene occurred.\nThe whole host-horse, camel, spear, and rifle men\n-some 10,000 strong, advanced amid a cloud of\ndust across the ridge of hills, shouting, singing, and\nwaving their banners in exultation over their\nimagined victory. They were led by a splendidly-\nbuilt man, attired in a white quilted jibba and\nmounted on a snow-white Arab, and it was believed\nat first that he must have been Mahmud himself.\nHowever, spies ascertained that it was the Emir Ali\nSenusi who was in command of the assembled force,\nand that Mahmud, with another army, was some\nthree miles away in the desert.\n\"The Egyptian loss was one man wounded, who\neventually died. The Dervish loss was never\naccurately known, but it must have been close\non 1,000, counting killed and wounded. Two guns\nwere destroyed, and three dismounted. The gun-\nboats fired some 653 shells and several thousand\nrounds of Maxim cartridge. The Dervish artillery\nwas commanded by Ahmed Fudel, a celebrated\nleader who fought in the battle against the\nAbyssinians when King John met his death, and\n"

Accordingly, on the Ist of\nNovember, the boats Zafir (Keppel), Nazir\n(Hood), and Metemmeh (Keith-Falconer), started\nonce more up the river. Each boat carried 50 men\nof the 3rd battalion, and Major Stuart-Wortley 2\naccompanied the Naval Commandant as Staff\nOfficer. The flotilla was reinforced on its way up\nby the Fatteh (Beatty), which had been patrolling\nthe Atbara river. The fleet continued up the Nile\nuntil it reached a small island a few miles from its\ndestination, where it lay for the night. Captain\nKeppel intended to arrive at Metemmeh by daybreak,\nin order that he might reach the Sixth Cataract, and\nreturn, before the night.\nWhen the fleet came within sight of Metemmeh\nthere was great activity and excitement amongst the\nDervishes. The hills soon became thronged with\ninfantry, cavalry, and camelry, which was apparently\nintended as a show of strength, and a warning of\nwhat was to be expected if there was any attempt\nto land.\nThe gunboats poured a terrific fire into the forts,\n1 We are indebted to the Morning Post for the above graphic\naccount.\n2 See page 19.\n"

The reply, however, was poor and ill-\ndirected, most of the missiles falling into the river.\nAfter shelling the place for some time, the gunboats\nput on extra steam and moved rapidly up the river\ntowards the Sixth Cataract. As they cleared\nMetemmeh the fleet entirely destroyed a large camp,\npitched in a sheltered khor (valley) behind a ridge,\nwhich proved to be the camp, or \"dem,\" of Zeki.\nThe fleet reached Shabluka, on the right bank of\nthe Sixth Cataract, and the whole of the country\nabove Metemmeh was observed to be deserted-a\ncertain sign of the Dervishes' presence. There was\nnot a boat or craft of any kind on the river, the\nDervishes had moved them for safety above the\ncataract.\nOn their return journey the boats came in for a\nwarm reception as they passed the enemy's forts,\nbut, with the exception of three men who were\nwounded by the bursting of a shrapnel shell, no\ndamage or loss was sustained, and they returned to\nBerber well satisfied with the result of their mission.\nThe Khalifa's refusal to send supplies to Metem-\nmeh placed Mahmud's garrison in sore straits.

But the only\nalarm created was in their own breasts, for they dis-\ncovered to their cost that the villagers had been\narmed with Remingtons, and had been trained to\nuse them with such good effect that the Dervishes\nwere forced to beat a hasty retreat.\nOne party was observed in the act of raiding\non the left bank, by Lieutenant Hood, in the\nNazir, whilst patrolling south of Ed Damer.\nHood immediately landed fourteen men of the\n10th Soudanese, three native gunners, and a ser-\ngeant of Marine Artillery, who were charged by\nsixty Dervish horsemen, but the latter were re-\npulsed with the loss of four killed and one wounded.\nThe party then returned to the boat, which pursued\nthe enemy as they rode along the river, and inflicted\nfurther loss on them with shrapnel.\nOn the 31st of October the desert railway from\nWady Halfa was opened to Abu Hamed; and the\nEgyptian Government decided to continue the line\nto Berber, for which purpose they voted £200,000.\nThe work was continued without delay, for the\nextension would do much to improve the commis-\nsariat arrangements.\n"

It can easily be understood\nthat the transfer of a fortress, and native troops of\nthe garrison, from one Power to another, be they\nnever so friendly, requires considerable tact and\ndelicacy. The native battalion readily consented\nto transfer their allegiance to the Khedive, but the\ncorps of Arab Irregulars (chiefly of the Hadendowa\ntribe) were rather reluctant to do so, until they were\nsatisfied that their position under the new régime\nwould be in no way inferior, and that they would\nbe permitted to wear the medals which they had\nearned whilst fighting under the Italian flag. Alto-\ngether 700 men were taken over, and added to the\nEgyptian Army, the corps being known as the\n\"Ortah Wadanieh.\"\nOn the 20th of December, Colonel Parsons did a\nvery tactful stroke of business. He paraded these\nnewly-acquired troops, and to their amazement and\nimmense delight, ordered them to make an attack\non El Fasher and Osobri, two Dervish posts on the\nAtbara river, about fifty miles from Kassala. Aroda,\na chief of the Beni Amir tribe of Arabs, who\nhad formerly been a cavalry leader under Osman\nDigna, was to attack El Fasher with 300 regulars\nand 100 irregulars, whilst Assabala, a chief of the\nShukrieh Arabs, was directed to attack Osobri\nwith 120 regulars and 60 irregulars. Colonel\nParson's orders occasioned the most tremendous ex-\ncitement amongst the men concerned, and they\nrushed off, shouting and gesticulating, to their\ndusky spouses to tell them of their good fortune.\n"
"CHAP. 111 THE ACQUISITION OF KASSALA\n187\nLater in the day, as the sun was setting, the\nstalwart and enthusiastic Arabs started on their\npurpose across the desert. Aroda attacked El\nFasher at daybreak on the 22nd, with complete\nsuccess.\nOf 200 who composed the Dervish gar-\nrison, 19-including three Emirs were killed, and\nthe rest took to flight. Assabala's task was not\ndisposed of quite so easily. He arrived before\nOsobri at daybreak on the 22nd, took the occupants\ncompletely by surprise, and captured 23 camels and\n70 head of cattle; but the 60 Dervish riflemen,\nforming the garrison, sought refuge in the fortress,\nand made a most heroic resistance, worthy of a\nbetter cause.\nFor six days they held out against\nthirst and hunger, waiting for help from their com-\nrades at Gedaref-120 miles distant-whilst Assa-\nbala invested the fortress as well as could be ex-\npected with his 180 men.\nDesperate sorties were repeatedly made, but were\nrepulsed by the fierce Arabs forming the invest-\nment. The fall of Osobri, on the 27th and 28th of\nDecember, has been well described by the war\ncorrespondent of the Times, and his account shows\nthe reckless bravery of the Dervishes. He says:\n\"The moon had already set, when, at about\n10 o'clock, it being very dark, a body of 50\nDervishes, carrying food and water with them, who\nhad come from Safir, made a most gallant effort to\nrelieve the garrison. Assabala's force being in-\nsufficient to complete the investing cordon, the fort\nwas surrounded by a ring of isolated companies,\n"
"188\nPART IN\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nwith a considerable interval separating the one from\nthe other. Thus, when the Dervishes engaged one\nof these companies, it was not possible for Assabala\nto send supports, as by doing so he would have\nleft a broad space open for the escape of the\ngarrison. The men of this particular company\nexhausted all their ammunition in repelling the\nenemy, and killed, according to the first accounts\nthat reached us, 20 out of the 50, but these\nnumbers are probably exaggerated. They then fell\nback on the next company in order to procure\nammunition, and the relieving Dervishes, promptly\ntaking advantage of the opportunity, rushed through\nthe gap thus left in the cordon, passed through the\ngate which was opened to them, and joined their\ncomrades in the fort, when the gate was once more\nquickly closed. It was certainly a most heroic\nperformance on the part of these 50, for, in view\nof all the circumstances, they were going to almost\ncertain death.\n\"At this juncture Aroda arrived from El Fasher\nwith his 200 men, and the cordon was made much\ncloser. The Dervishes from Safir had been so\nhard pressed that they had failed to carry any\nwater with them into the fort for the succour of\nthe suffering garrison: consequently, about an hour\nlater, 20 mounted men, led by an Emir, made\na desperate rush from the fort towards the walls\noutside.

After this there was a\ndesultory exchange of rifle fire between the besiegers\nand besieged, until a few hours before dawn, when\na\nsmall body of Baggara horsemen (from 13\nto 15) suddenly appeared. They had come from\nGedaref, having made a circuit so as to avoid\nour post at El Fasher. They attacked a party of\nour men who were guarding the Safir road; and\nthe besieged, on hearing the firing, began to open\na very heavy fire in the direction of the wells\nwhich are on the other side of the fort. This was\nintended as a feint, and it proved wholly successful.\nOur men closed in round the wells to keep the\nDervishes off the water, but the Dervishes suddenly\nissued from the other side of the fort, where the\nroad was now left open to them, and fled in the\ndirection of Safir, their retreat being covered by\nthe Baggara horsemen.\"\nMost of the wretched garrison that escaped the\nbullet or spear met with a worse fate. In their\nhasty flight they had left behind them their bag-\ngage, provisions, and water. Between them and\nthe nearest wells was a twelve hours' march over\nthe parched desert. They had suffered dreadfully\nduring the siege from thirst and hunger, and were,\nat the time of their escape, well nigh physically\nexhausted.\nThe siege demonstrated that the Dervish was\nstill capable of great bravery in the face of the\nenemy; not mere reckless bravery during the heat\nof battle, but bravery that unflinchingly faces hunger\n"

These sons of the\ndesert could be made into a most formidable body\nof soldiers, equal in physique, stamina, and mobility\nto any in the world. The Italians had subjected\nthem to a certain kind of discipline; they were not\ndrilled in the rigid manner of the Egyptians, but a\nhappy medium had been found, which though not\ndamping the fierce ardour of these warriors, enabled\nthem to be properly handled and directed in the\nfield.

The\nformal ceremony took place at noon on Christmas\nDay, and, though short, was very impressive. The\ntroops of the garrison, under the command of Colonel\nSamincatelli, formed in line on the north side of\nthe entrance to the main gate of the fort. The\nEgyptians, who had marched from their camp, were\nformed up in line facing the Italian troops. Colonel\nParsons, riding down between the lines, asked in\nArabic for permission to enter Kassala.

"198\nPART IV\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nThe Dervishes were showing signs of activity\nafter the manner peculiar to them. On the 18th of\nJanuary, a force, 200 strong, under Osman Digna,\ndescended on the village of Gamer, and carried off\nthe women, camels, and cattle; but the Egyptian\ndetachment from Ed Damer pursued them, and\nrecaptured the booty. On the same day, El Sofyieh,\nabout 150 miles east of Khartoum-together with 10\nprisoners and 1,300 sheep-fell into the hands of our\nFriendly Arabs operating round Kassala. The\nDervishes also raided the Kababish Arabs, in the\nBayuda desert. On the 20th of January, a raid\noccurred at Kunur, only fifteen miles from Berber,\nbut the Egyptian cavalry attacked and dispersed\nthe Dervishes, killing five of them, and taking two\nprisoners.\nMahmud made no movement until the 10th of\nFebruary, when he commenced to convey his troops\nacross the Nile from Metemmeh to Shendy. He\nraised some boats, which the Dervishes had sunk\nduring the reconnaissances of the gunboats, and, by\nmeans of these and other boats and rafts, he com-\nmenced his difficult task, which lasted nearly a fort-\nnight. The Sirdar did not attempt to harass the\nDervish leader or prevent him crossing, but allowed\nhim every opportunity to carry out his movement,\nand to march and attack the Anglo-Egyptian Army.\nOn the 25th of February, Mahmud completed the\npassage of the Nile, and was ere long afforded an\nopportunity of proving what a fatal mistake he had\nmade.

As it was, Mahmud's army now found\nitself in the angle formed by the Nile and the\nAtbara, and it was next to impossible to return with-\nout giving battle. This movement had been under-\ntaken at the instigation of the Khalifa, who had\nordered Mahmud either to return to Omdurman\nimmediately, or to advance on Berber, break up the\nrailway at Gineinetti, and destroy the Egyptian\nArmy. Had the Khalifa been correctly informed\nof the strength of the Sirdar's force, he must have\nknown that, no matter how brave his troops, this\nwould be an absolute impossibility-as far as human\naffairs can be certain. As it was, the intentions of\nthe Dervish leader were known in every detail to\nhis opponent, and nothing could have been more\nopportune than Mahmud's action of bringing the\npick of the Khalifa's forces to be destroyed by the\nSirdar.\nDuring Mahmud's move across the river, Captain\nKeppel, R.N., took the opportunity of making his\nflotilla's presence felt. Mahmud had entrenched\n200 riflemen to cover the crossing; these were\ndriven out by the gunboats, which steamed quite\nclose to the bank, and swept the parapet with Maxim\nfire.

The first course-to retire-would have been\nmorally impossible; the loss of prestige would have\nhad such a demoralising effect upon his forces that\nhe would have lost all control over them. He re-\nmembered, moreover, the fate of certain leaders\nwho had returned, unsuccessful, to the Khalifa, and\nhad promptly lost their heads. The second course\n-to attack the Sirdar-Mahmud considered impru-\ndent, especially when he heard the real strength of\nhis opponent's force. Of the three evils, he chose\nthe least, and elected to remain where he was. His\nposition was desperate, for with his depot at Shendy\ndestroyed, and his line of retreat cut off, he was\npractically besieged and without hope of supplies.\nFood was rapidly becoming scarce, and, to make\nmatters worse, a portion of his force (chiefly the\nSoudanese) was becoming disaffected, and the death\npenalty for attempted desertion was being inflicted\ndaily. He kept his men hard at work, throwing up\nentrenchments and making the place as impregnable\nas possible. He had great confidence in these en-\ntrenchments, and seems to have buoyed himself up\nwith some degree of hope that his entrenched and\nprotected riflemen would be able to repulse any\nattempt the Sirdar's forces might make to carry the\nposition.

He had devoutly hoped\nand expected that Mahmud, on finding his retreat\ncut off, would have advanced to meet him in open\nbattle. In fact it has since been ascertained that\nthe Khalifa had issued distinct orders to that effect\nthough Osman Digna had prudently counselled a\nretreat in the direction of Adarama.\nThe Sirdar decided to make another effort to get\nMahmud out into the open desert. On the 4th of\nApril, he moved his army five miles on, to Abadar,\nand on the following morning, at daybreak, he sent\nMajor-General Hunter, with a strong force of all\narms, to further reconnoitre the \"Dem.\" On General\nHunter's staff were Brevet-Major Kincaid, A.A.G.,\nCaptain Sir H.

As they retired, a body of Dervish riflemen,\nwho were in support, opened a heavy fire on the\nEgyptian troopers, whom they attempted to sur-\nround. General Hunter immediately ordered the\ncavalry to retire, covering their retreat with artillery\nand Maxim fire; and the Dervish horsemen then\nengaged them on both flanks, but were driven\nback by a combined charge, headed by Colonel\nBroadwood, Major Le Gallais, and Captain Persse ;\nafter which both the opposing forces withdrew. Our\ncasualties were six Egyptians killed and ten wounded;\nCaptain Persse received a bullet in the forearm.\nThe Dervishes sustained considerable loss. The\nMaxims fired over 4,000 rounds during the engage-\nment, which brought into further evidence the great\nvalue of this weapon.\nThanks to the reconnaissances, and to the infor-\nmation given by deserters-who were continually\ncoming in-the Sirdar had gained a considerable\ninsight into the condition of his opponent's army,\nand the position of his \"Dem,\" or zariba; and\nseeing that Mahmud was intent on holding his\nground, the Sirdar decided to settle the matter once\nand for all, and storm the position.\nNeedless to say, the news of the Sirdar's intended\nattack was received with the greatest enthusiasm by\nthe British and native troops, and the prospect of\nsoon meeting the enemy in battle raised their spirits\nto the highest pitch.

For are not the heat, dust, glare, and\nthe hundred and one privations which before seemed\nalmost insupportable, compensated for over and over\nagain by the prospect of a really good fight?\nThe British Brigade were, as we like to think\nour soldiers always are, fit to go anywhere and do\nanything. There were practically no sick, and no\ngeneral ever took the field with a finer body of men.\nEarly on Wednesday, the 6th of April, the Sirdar\nmoved his whole force from Abadar to Umdabia, a\ndeserted village on the Atbara, about seven and a\nhalf miles from the enemy's position. On their\narrival a zariba was constructed out of the thorny\nmimosa bushes, on the bank of the river, and the\ntroops lay there during Wednesday and Thursday.\nThe men spent their spare time in thoroughly\ncleaning their rifles, on which they appeared to\nbestow quite loving care, and nearly every man\nused his only handkerchief to wrap round the\nbreech and keep the sand out. During these two\ndays the Sirdar was busy with his final preparations.\nThe baggage to be taken was reduced to the barest\nnecessities, and the troops were to move in the\nP2\n"

The British Brigade were\nsupplied with 127 rounds of ammunition per man,\nand the native troops carried from 100 to 150\nrounds each.\nWhen the heat of the sun had slackened, a little\nafter five in the afternoon of Thursday (7th), the\ninfantry, Maxims, and two squadrons of cavalry\nmoved out, in battle array, about a mile and a half\ninto the desert. At 6 P.M. the force commenced\nthe march. The remaining six squadrons of cavalry\nand four batteries of artillery remained for the\nnight in camp and followed in the early morning.\nHalf the 15th Battalion of the Egyptian Army were\nleft behind here in strong zariba, to guard the\nstores, hospital, and transport. All the camp fires\nwere kept burning, so that should any patrolling\nDervishes be in the vicinity, they might continue\nunder the impression that the army was still there.\nThe route was shown by native guides, as usual,\nand the direction was checked by Captain Fitton,\nD.A.A.G. Gatacre was in front with his British\nBrigade, behind them came Macdonald and his\nSoudanese, then came Lewis's Brigade and the\nCamel Corps, and lastly Maxwell's Brigade. Each\nbrigade marched in battalion squares, in echelon,\nthe intervals being about 300 or 400 yards.\nThe march lay through the desert, at a distance\nvarying from half a mile to a mile from the river,\nthus avoiding the stiff mimosa shrubs along the\nbank.

The position looked a formidable object\nto assault; forming the outside barrier was a\nstrong zariba of mimosa bushes, behind which were\npalisades of strong palm logs, and in the interior\nof the work were innumerable cross-trenches,\ncasemates, and straw huts. It was evident that\nthe advance was well-known to the enemy, for one\ncould plainly see the Emirs moving about, giving\ntheir final orders.\nAt a quarter past six the guns were run into\nposition and opened fire. Two good artillery posi-\ntions had been chosen, so as to bring a cross-fire on\nthe enemy's entrenchments, which were now sub-\njected to a raking cannonade. Twelve guns came into\naction at each of these points, and were assisted by\na rocket detachment under Lieutenant Beatty, R.N.\nThe rocket battery was first of all on rising ground\non the left, but finding the range too great for\neffective use, it moved round to the right, and,\ngetting into range at 500 yards, succeeded in setting\nthe \"Dem\" on fire in several places the straw\n"

The bombardment lasted an hour and a\nhalf, during which time scarcely a sound came from\nthe zariba. About a quarter to seven some im-\npulsive Dervishes fired a few shots at Macdonald's\nBrigade, but they aimed too high, and the bullets\nwhizzed harmlessly overhead. Considering the\ndestruction that was being dealt out all round\nthem, by this veritable hail of lead and fire, the\nself-restraint evinced by the Dervishes was truly\nremarkable.\nAt a quarter past seven the troops were formed\nfor the assault, as follows: Along the front of the\nBritish Brigade were the Cameron Highlanders, ex-\ntended in line, and following behind them, in column\nof companies, were the Warwicks (on the left), the\nSeaforths (centre), and the Lincolns (on the right).\nContinuing the line to the right was Macdonald's\nbrigade of Soudanese-the 11th, 10th, and 9th\nBattalions, each with two companies in line, and the\nremaining four companies behind in column of\ncompanies, as a support.

On the extreme left (to the\nleft rear of the Warwicks), was Lewis's reserve\nbrigade, consisting of the 3rd and 4th Battalions\n(Egyptian Army), to keep in check the Dervish\ncavalry, and to prevent any flank movement.\nThe Cavalry and Horse Artillery were posted on\nthe left, half a mile away in the desert, to watch the\nenemy's horsemen. The twenty-four guns, under\nColonel Long, were on the right flank, and the\ntwelve Maxims were divided amongst the right and\nleft flanks and the centre.\nAs soon as the troops had taken up the above\npositions, they were severally addressed by their\ncommanding officers. General Gatacre, in a stirring\nspeech, told the British Brigade that there was to\nbe no mistake about this, they were to drive the\nDervishes right through into the river. Colonel\nMurray concluded his exhortation to the Seaforths\nby saying that \"The news of victory must be in\nLondon to-night.\" In a novel, or on the stage,\nthese words would doubtless have been hailed with\nmuch noise and cheering, but as a matter of fact\nthey were received in grim silence; the men, how-\never, were ready and eager for action, and bent on\ngiving a good account of themselves.\nAnd now the artillery bombardment ceases; the\nSirdar and his staff take up a commanding position\nwhence they can best survey the field of action;\nthe other mounted officers, including Generals\n"

At last, at a quarter\nto eight, the bugles ring out the \"Advance,\" and in\nan instant the bands of the native regiments, and\nthe buglers of the Warwicks and Lincolns, burst\nforth into stirring marches, and the pipers of the\nHighlanders skirl their loudest; whilst the whole\nforce advances in quick time, with colours flying,\nas steadily as if on parade. A more imposing\nspectacle it is impossible to imagine, than this array\nof brave men advancing literally to death or glory.\nEvery few yards the line halts for a moment, and\n\"independent firing\" is kept up vigorously. Then\nthe line moves forward again.1\nSuddenly, as the force arives within 200 yards of\nthe zariba, the Dervishes, who until now had\nreserved their defence with remarkable coolness, -\nopen a searching fire. Men begin to drop on all\nsides, but, steady and irresistible as a great tidal\nwave, the force sweeps on, still in the same perfect\norder. Now Maxwell's and Macdonald's troops,\nin their impetuosity, push slightly ahead. The\nCamerons at length reach the top of a crest, within\na hundred yards of the zariba-whence the ground\nslopes gently down towards the position and a\nbitter and well-sustained fire from the enemy seems\nto sweep through and through their ranks.

In rather less than five minutes gaps\nhave been made at intervals along the line, suffi-\nciently large to admit the troops to pass through.\nIt was now eight o'clock. Within a quarter of an\nhour of the general \"Advance\" being first sounded,\nthe entry into the zariba had been effected. It\nhad been intended that as soon as the Camerons\nhad made sufficiently large gaps in the zariba,\nthe British battalions in rear were to push on,\nthrough the ranks of the Camerons, into the “Dem”;\nand that when the leading company of the Seaforths\nhad advanced fifty yards beyond the zariba, they\nwere to halt and allow the companies behind to\ndeploy on them.

It was found, how-\never, that this scheme was impracticable, for the\ncrowded rifle-pits, with which the interior of the\n\"Dem\" was covered, had to be reckoned with. A\nsteady deployment in face of rifle-fire at twenty\npaces was, of course, out of the question; besides\nwhich, it was not likely that the Camerons, after\nbearing practically the brunt of the fight-we are\nspeaking, of course, only of the British Brigade-\nup to this point, were going to stand still at the\nmost critical moment, and allow the regiments be-\nhind to supersede them. Such a thing would have\nbeen morally impossible.\nHeaded by their officers, the Camerons rush\nforward through the gaps. Captain Findlay was\nthe first of the British Brigade to cross the zariba,\nbut ere he had gone many yards he was mortally\nwounded, being shot in the chest and stomach,\nbesides being wounded by a spear. \"Go on, my\ncompany, and give it them,\" he called out, and a\nquarter of an hour afterwards he was dead.1 The\nSeaforths rush into the zariba, following closely on\nthe heels of the Camerons, then the Lincolns and\nthe Warwicks get through; and the whole of the\nBritish Brigade presses on in line, or rather, in the\nbest attempt at a line that the circumstances permit.\n1 Captain C.

It\nis not a question of merely driving the enemy out\nof the zariba, but rather of despatching every single\nDervish separately. The enemy remain at their\nposts, firing steadily, and officers and men are falling\nright and left.\nMajor Urquhart (Camerons) was one of the first\nto fall, shot through the sporran top by a Dervish\nwho lay hidden amongst his dead comrades in one\nof the trenches. He managed to call out \"Never\nmind me, lads, go on,\" and then fell dead.1 Soon\nafterwards Major Napier, of the same regiment,\nwas dangerously wounded in the thigh by a large\nconical bullet from an elephant rifle.

The\nSoudanese danced with delight, and went wildly\naround shaking hands with every one they came\nacross. As the Sirdar and his staff rode up, they\nwere met with a perfect roar of cheers, and helmets\nand tarboushes were waved on the ends of the\nbayonets. The Sirdar was greatly moved by the\ngenuine welcome of his victorious soldiers, and\nthanked them for the unflinching manner in which\nthey had done their duty. He promoted on the\nfield (provisionally) to the rank of subaltern the\nsergeant-major of every native regiment that crossed\nthe zariba. Addressing Colonel Money, of the\nCameron Highlanders, the Sirdar remarked, \"What\nyour battalion has done was one of the finest feats\nperformed for many years. You ought to be proud\nof such a regiment.\" He also spoke in highly\neulogistic terms of the steadiness with which the\nother regiments had advanced to the attack, and of\nthe dash with which they entered the zariba.\nThe troops were then re-formed, in brigade\nsquares, to the right of the ground where the\nattack had commenced.\n"

Officers\nand men were buried in the clothes in which they\nhad fought and fallen, and were wrapped in a regu-\nlation blanket. The funeral of the 3 British officers\nand 18 men was most impressive.

It put an end to the only army\nin the Soudan intended for aggressive purposes and\ncleared the whole desert north of the Sixth Cataract\nof the Dervishes.\nAfter church parade on the 10th of April, the\nSirdar read to the British Brigade the message of\nthe Queen, who is ever so thoughtful and solicitous\nfor the wounded, in these words:- \"I greatly rejoice\nat the brilliant victory. I desire to be fully in-\nformed as to the state of the wounded.\" The troops,\non the invitation of the Sirdar, gave three hearty\ncheers for her Majesty.

The German Press were, for the most part,\nlukewarm, as they usually are when speaking of any\nforeign successes. The victory was a complete\nvindication of the policy of the British Government,\nand it will be long before a possible excuse can be\nmade by the enemies of Great Britain or Egypt to\nbreak the inseverable ties which bind these countries\ntogether.\nThe Sirdar made his formal entry into the\nSoudan (at Berber) on the 14th of April, at the head\nof Macdonald's Brigade. The route was kept by the\ntroops of the garrison. The town was en fête and\ndecorated as well as could be with the appliances and\nthe materials available. Mahmud was given every\nopportunity of exhibiting himself as the central\nfigure. When the procession had reached the\ncentral square in the town, the Sirdar took up his\nposition in a canopied platform, where the whole of\nthe troops marched past in review order. The\ntroops moved into summer quarters, the British\nBrigade going to Darmali, midway between Berber\nand the Atbara-and thus ended the second part of\nthe expedition.\n*\n*\n*\n*\nDuring the lull in the storm we may conveniently\nallude to a so-called grievance on the part of the\n\"Specials,\" which in August, 1897, was taken up\nwith considerable warmth by the papers represented.\nBriefly, this grievance lay in the fact that the Sirdar\n"
"232\nPART IV\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nhad issued an order (August, 1897) by which the\ncorrespondents were forbidden to go further south\nthan Railhead (then situated in the Nubian desert,\nbetween Murat Wells and Abu Hamed), the reason\nset forth for this being the difficulties attending the\nTransport and Commissariat Department. This\norder the correspondents consented to comply with\nat the time; but later on-in January, 1898-when\nanother movement was on foot, they raised\na veritable whirlwind of indignation against the\nSirdar, in their \"dailies,\" at what they were pleased\nto consider a most uncalled for order. The plea of\ntransport difficulties, put forward by the Sirdar, was\nonly a minor reason for his decision. The truth of\nthe matter was that he, like the majority of the\ncommanders in the field, looked upon the corre-\nspondents in the light of a doubtful blessing. The\nemployment of correspondents in war has always\nbeen a matter of controversy, and one which on\nthis occasion reached such an acute stage that it\ndeserves more than a passing notice. The war\ncorrespondents representing the London daily papers\nare a class of men upon whose honour and discretion\nreliance might be placed, and they are furthermore\nsubjected to the censorship of the officers appointed\nfor the purpose; but notwithstanding every precau-\ntion being taken, it is quite possible that, unwittingly\nand by some excess of zeal, information might be\npublished which should have been suppressed.

Any indiscretion\non the part of a correspondent in disclosing some\nplan of the general's, or causing any sensation or\nneedless alarm, might entail endless trouble-as was\nshown more than once during the Franco-German\nwar. It was naturally the Sirdar's primary object\nto prevent the Khalifa obtaining any information as\nto his movements; and this object was now on a\nfair way to being thwarted by these energetic\ngentlemen. Truly \"the pen is mightier than the\nsword.\" It may be asked, \"How could the news in\nFleet Street benefit the Khalifa in Omdurman?\"\nThe answer is, that there were many individuals\noutside the Soudan, who, if not actually the Khalifa's\nagents, were at any rate ready and willing to furnish\nhim with such information as they thought he might\nbe able to turn to good account. Now that the\nSuakin-Berber route was closed to the Dervishes\nthe transmission of intelligence to Omdurman was\nrendered far more difficult, but, even now, scraps of\nintelligence, gathered by the aimless French mission-\naries wandering in Central Africa, found their way\nto the Khalifa's ears.\nNor were the Dervishes the only ones to be\nguarded against in this matter. The campaign in\nthe Soudan was watched, for many different reasons,\nby a number of more or less interested nations-\nall eager to take advantage of any informa-\ntion that might prove useful to them.

Again, it must be borne in mind that, in a\nfree constitution such as our own, where the popular\nwill is supreme, it is of the utmost importance that the\ngeneral public should have the very fullest informa-\ntion of any campaign in which the country may be\nengaged, in order that they may sympathetically\nfollow it, so that, should they at any time be called\nupon to decide on the prosecution of the war, they\nwould be in a position to form a sound opinion on\nthe matter, instead of being carried away by false\nrepresentations. The recent operations on the\nIndian frontier supply us with a good instance of\nthe danger in obtaining news second-hand and from\nunreliable quarters. In this case all kinds of false\nand ridiculous stories were circulated to the discredit\nof the army and its leaders.\na\nFull information of the doings of our soldiers\nand sailors encourages\nstrong national and\npatriotic feeling, binding the nation closer in a\ncommon enthusiasm.

During a review there of the whole\nDervish force, Ali Wad Helu, who was second\nin command to the Khalifa, was heading a charge\nwhich was to be a rehearsal of the final trium-\nphant onslaught on the infidel invaders, when\nhe was thrown heavily; his arm was fractured,\nand he received other injuries.\nOn Wednesday, the 24th of August, the Sirdar\nheld a review, at Wad Hamed, of the whole of\nthe Anglo-Egyptian force, in battle array. It seems\nopportune to give here a list of the troops engaged :--\nBRITISH DIVISION (Major-General Gatacre).\n1st Brigade (Brigadier-General Wauchope) :-\nIst Battalion Cameron Highlanders.\nIst Battalion Seaforth Highlanders.\n"

It had been\nexpected all along that the Khalifa would offer re-\nsistance at some point between the Sixth Cataract\nand his capital, and it was thought that the scene of\naction would probably be in the neighbourhood of\nKerreri. There is no doubt that this was the\nKhalifa's original intention; but, as events showed,\nhe subsequently changed his mind, and the Dervishes\nfell back before the steady advance of the Sirdar's\nforces. The Sirdar was kept well informed, by the\nconstant stream of fugitives who came into camp\ndaily, of everything transpiring in Omdurman, and\nit now appeared certain that the last stand of\nthe enemy would be before the gates of the\ncapital.\nOn the following day (27th) the army moved\nto a new camp at Um Teref, a distance of nine\nmiles.

The gun-\nboat Zafir suddenly sank near Shendy, at a\ndistance of about sixty yards from the shore, the\nvessel's funnels remaining visible.

In a village through which the troops\npassed some charred and mutilated bodies were\nseen, and it was rightly conjectured that these\nunfortunates had been suspected as spies and burnt\nin their homes.\nThe mounted troops made a complete recon-\nnaissance of the city of Omdurman, and saw the\nKhalifa's army drawn up, in five immense divisions,\nto the north-west of the town, out in the desert.\nThey reconnoitred five miles to the west of\nOmdurman, and, as they drew near, the whole\nDervish force, numbering between 40,000 and\n50,000, moved rapidly over the plain towards\nthem. So swift was their advance that they almost\ncame into action with our reconnoitring force: but\nthe Khalifa evidently considered that the propitious\nmoment had not yet come, and the Dervish army\nsuddenly came to an abrupt halt.\nIn the afternoon the troops zaribaed on a ridge\nat Sururab, six miles north of Kerreri, and spent\nthe night there.

Stuart-Wortley was ordered by the\nSirdar to clear the east bank as far as the Blue\nNile, in order to enable the howitzer battery to be\nlanded and placed in position to shell Omdurman.\nSeveral villages were found occupied, and these the\n\"Friendlies\" cleared, one after the other. One\nbody of Dervishes made an obstinate resistance, in\novercoming which the \"Friendlies\" lost twelve\nkilled and thirty wounded. As soon as all was\nclear on that side of the river, the howitzers were\nlanded from the barges towed by the steamers, and\nthe bombardment¹ of Omdurman began (Thursday,\n1st). The gunboats, at the same time, engaged the\nDervish forts of Omdurman, Khartoum, and Tati\nIsland, and heavy firing was maintained for several\nhours. In the end the whole of the forts were de-\nstroyed, several breaches were made in the great\nwall of Omdurman, and the dome of the Mahdi's\ntomb-a very conspicuous object-was shattered.\nThe mounted troops again rode within five\nmiles of the city, and found the Khalifa's army,\n1 Before ordering the bombardment, the Sirdar sent a message to\nthe Khalifa, warning him to remove the women and children.\n"

It appeared certain that the\nDervishes would attack, and the Sirdar accordingly\nadvanced his army about a thousand yards into the\ndesert, where he formed up in line of battle, with the\ncavalry out in front, and the reserves in laager\nbehind.

At 5.30 A.M. the gunboats\nand the howitzers-which, as we have seen, had been\nlanded on the opposite (right) bank of the river—\nbegan the bombardment of Omdurman, and the\nbooming of the guns could be distinctly heard in\nthe still early morning air.

Suddenly they wheeled in the direction of\nthe zariba, and bore down towards our south front.\nThe Warwicks, Seaforths, Camerons, and Lincolns\nset their sights at 1800 yards, and poured in steady\nvolleys; the rattling Maxims joined the musketry\nchorus, and the enemy pressed on with fanatical\ncourage. About seven o'clock the Rifle Brigade and\nsix companies of the Lancashire Fusiliers moved from\nthe extreme left, and came up, at the double, in\nsupport of the 1st Brigade. The Dervishes could\nmake but little headway against the storm of\nbullets; but they succeeded in getting within 800\nyards, when they opened a heavy musketry fire, and\ncasualties began to occur rapidly inside the zariba.\nAmong the first to fall was Captain Caldecott, 1\nof the Warwickshire regiment, who was shot\nthrough the head, and a few minutes afterwards\nMr. Charles Williams (Daily Chronicle)\nwounded, and Colonel Rhodes, the Times corre-\nspondent (brother of Mr. Cecil Rhodes), was shot\nin the shoulder and obliged to leave the field.\nCaptain Clarke (Camerons) received a bullet in\nwas\n1 Captain Guy Caldecott joined the service in 1886, became\ncaptain in 1892, and was thirty-two years of age.\nS2\n"

A force of 10,000 Dervishes\nsuddenly swept down on them, and before the slow-\nmoving camels could be started, the force was in\ndanger of being surrounded and cut off from the\ncamp, towards which it slowly retreated. The\nfighting was so severe that the horse battery had\ntwo teams killed, and were obliged to dismantle a\ncouple of guns and leave them in the hands of the\nDervishes.

The force moved towards Omdurman\nin an échelon of brigades from the left. (See\nPlan 2.) The ground was of a very broken nature,\nwhich considerably retarded the advance.\nOn nearing Surgham Hill, the Sirdar ordered\nMaxwell to clear it of a party of the enemy, who\nwere firing at the summit. For this purpose two\ncompanies of the 13th (Egyptian) battalion, under\nCaptain Capper (East Lancashire Regiment, E.A.)\nwere detailed, and they gallantly stormed and\noccupied the position.\nNo sooner had they done so, than very heavy\nfiring was heard on the right.

Thanks to\nthe excellent fire-discipline of the Soudanese, the\nenemy never succeeded in driving the attack home,\nthough they got within 300 yards of the line.\nThe Baggara cavalry, on this occasion, showed\nremarkable and reckless daring. They evidently\nintended to break through our lines and divert\nour fire, so as to give the Dervish infantry an\nopening. To carry this out was hopeless, for\nit meant riding to certain death, but they\ngalloped forward in loose open order, their ranks\npresenting one long ridge of flashing swords.\nEvery soldier in the Sirdar's army watched breath-\nlessly this daring feat. Nearer and nearer they\ncame until the foremost horseman emerged almost\nwithin 200 yards of Macdonald's lines. A con-\ntinuous stream of bullets from our lines was\nemptying the saddles, but on they came until not\na\nsingle horseman was left. One Baggara\nsucceeded in getting within 30 yards of the lines\nbefore he fell. The whole of the Dervish cavalry\nhad been annihilated. There is no instance in\nhistory of a more superb devotion to a cause, or\nof greater contempt for death, than was shown on\nthis occasion.\nThis, however, was but a prelude to a display of\nalmost equally reckless courage on the part of the\nDervish infantry, in their last despairing effort.\n"

Hundreds planted their banners de-\nfiantly in the ground, and gathered round them only\nto drop lifeless at the foot, as the price of their\ndevotion. The carnage was fearful, as the dauntless\nfanatics hurled themselves to inevitable death.\nMost noticeable of all was the Emir Yacoub, who\nbore forward the great black banner of the Khalifa\n(his brother), surrounded by his relatives and de-\nvoted followers. Although decimated by the hail of\nbullets before and around them, they surged\nforward, until only a mere handful of men remained\naround the flag; and these, never faltering, rushed\nonwards until they dropped dead beneath it.\nsaw\nThe whole force of the attack was concentrated\nagainst Macdonald's brigade, and but for the con-\nsummate generalship of their leader, the Soudanese\nmust have been destroyed.

After moving half-right for about\nhalf an hour, they halted, and the 32nd Field Battery\nmade good practice on this body of the enemy,\nwhile the British fired long-range volleys. The\nDervishes were checked, and the cavalry went out\non the left flank to head them off.\nAt this point (about 9 o'clock) occurred one of the\nmost brilliant features of the battle. The Sirdar,\ndesiring to cut off the fugitive Dervishes from Omdur-\nman, and to force them into the desert, sent forward\nthe cavalry-the Egyptian troopers to the right, and\nthe 21st Lancers to the left. When the latter, under\nColonel Martin, had trotted a short distance, they\napproached a depression in the ground in which it\nwas thought about 200 Dervishes were concealed.\nHe wheeled the regiment into line, and ordered the\n66\nCharge\" to be sounded.

The two centre\nsquadrons suffered the most, seven of Captain\nDoyne's men being killed and eleven wounded,\nwhilst Major Fowle had nine killed and eleven\nwounded. Fowle himself killed the man he rode at,\nfired at another and missed him, and, shooting one\nmore, galloped up the bank clear of the Dervishes,\nthe bullets whistling all round him.

Every man who was unhorsed-\nwith the single exception of Major Pinches (Royal\nArmy Medical Corps) - was instantly killed. Pinches\nwas saved by the great daring of Sergeant-Major\nBrennan, who galloped to the rescue, and, after a\ntough fight, in the course of which Brennan killed\nseveral Dervishes, he got the officer on to his own\nhorse and carried him out of danger.\nMajor Wyndham had his horse shot as he was\ncharging from the khor, and was lying on the ground\nin a perfectly helpless position, having emptied his\nrevolver, when Captain Kenna galloped back, lifted\nhim up into the saddle, and bore him safely away.\nLieutenant Molyneux, of the Blues, came down when\na hundred yards beyond the khor, his horse being\nkilled. He ran on and was attacked by a couple of\nDervishes, one of whom he shot, but the other\ninflicted a severe sword-cut on his right arm, forcing\nhim to drop his revolver, and, being thus unarmed,\nhe had to run for his life.

Lieutenant Pirie,\nadjutant of the Lancers, and Lieutenant Brinton\n(Life Guards) were both wounded.1\nThe men followed the plucky lead given them by\ntheir officers in the most spirited manner, and many\nwere the instances of individual bravery recorded\namongst the rank and file. One of the most\nremarkable was that of Trooper Brown. Seeing one\nof his comrades, Trooper Varley, dismounted and\nsurrounded by Dervishes, Brown, though badly\nwounded himself, reined up just beyond the khor,\nand dragged Varley to a place of safety. He then\nturned again to rescue Trooper Rowlett, who,\nwounded in both arms and unhorsed, stood on the\nedge of the khor with a crowd of swordsmen rushing\nupon him. Brown galloped up in time, lifted\nRowlett on to his horse, carried him into safety,\nthen dressed his comrades' wounds.

Sergeant-Major Veysey,\nthough shot through the cheek, continued to rally\nthe men; and Trooper Ayton showed great pluck\nin rescuing a wounded comrade. These are but\na few instances of the gallantry shown by the men\nof the 21st.\nWhen the Lancers arrived four hundred yards\nfrom the other side of the khor, they dismounted,\nand opened fire on the enemy through whom they\nhad just charged, causing the latter to withdraw\nwestwards-so the Lancers had carried out their\norders, to head the enemy off from Omdurman.\nThe regiment was then formed up, and it was\nfound that, out of the 320 who rode in the charge,\nno less than 21 were killed (including Lieutenant\nGrenfell), and four officers and 46 men were\nwounded. Of their horses, 119 were killed and\nwounded. This brilliant affair was the more con-\nspicuous inasmuch as it formed no part of the\nSirdar's plan of attack.

Even now,\nthose Arabs who were on the verge of death,\nendeavoured by every means in their power to kill\nat least one more \"Turk\" before entering Paradise ;\nand these fanatics had to be despatched, by an advance\nparty of Soudanese, before the Sirdar's army could\nadvance with any degree of safety across the thickly\nstrewn battle-field.\nBy noon the battle was practically over, and the\nforce moved south to a muddy creek, called Khor\nShambat, to water and feed, having had nothing\nto eat for over seven hours, whilst the mounted\ntroops continued the pursuit.\nThus was the Khalifa overthrown, and Mahdism\ncrushed for ever. Never had there been a finer\nforce in the Soudan than that under the Sirdar;\nnever a more desperate nor more admirably-trained\narmy of Arabs, than that under the Khalifa; never\nhad there been, in the history of the Soudan, a\nmore bloody battle than that outside the walls of\nOmdurman.\n"

The\nthree chaplains then offered prayers, invoking divine\nmercy and blessing on the Soudan; and the\nSoudanese bands concluded the ceremony with\nGordon's favourite hymn \"Abide with Me.\" The\nmemory of those present went back to the pathetic\npicture of the lonely man who was locked in the con-\nfines of the desert surrounded by bloodthirsty and\nferocious enemies, and who, watching hourly for the\nhelp that came too late, fell a martyr to his country\nand his duty.\nAt the conclusion of the ceremony the Sirdar\nand troops returned to Omdurman, a detachment\nof the 11th Soudanese being left to guard the flags\nand to hold Khartoum.\nDuring the next two or three days the Sirdar\nreceived congratulatory telegrams from all parts of\nthe world, including one from H. M. the Queen,\nH. H. the Khedive, Lord Lansdowne, Lord\nWolseley, and a host of others.¹\nThe British regiments left the front, for Cairo,\nas fast as the steamers could take them, and by\nthe middle of the month most of them had again\nreturned to civilisation.\nOn the 7th of September the telegraph was\nbrought to Omdurman, and, on the same day,\n1 News of the victory reached London on Saturday afternoon. No\ninformation had been vouchsafed from the Soudan since the previous\nTuesday, owing to the telegraph line having broken down, and the\nanxiety which had been produced served only to increase the\nenthusiasm with which the joyful intelligence was received.\n"
"CHAP. IX\n283\nKHARTOUM-AND AFTER\nthe astounding news was received to the effect\nthat Fashoda was occupied by the French !\nFashoda, the capital of the Shilluk country, is\n918 miles, by river, from Khartoum. In 1865 the\nKhedive, Ismail Pasha, sent a force to that place,\nand established a military camp of a thousand men\nthere. In 1882, shortly after the commencement\nof the great rebellion, Ussuf Pasha, who was then\nGovernor of Fashoda, marched against the Mahdi,\nbut his army was unfortunately destroyed. This\nimportant Nile post is, of course, part of the\nKhedive's dominions; and the fact that his troops\nhad not been in the place for a lapse of years,\nin no way justified its occupation by another\npower.\nThe news of this latest development on the\nUpper Nile was brought by the captain of the\nDervish steamer, Tewfikieh, who had been sent up\nthe Blue Nile by the Khalifa, and now returned\nto find Omdurman in other hands. He at once\nsurrendered to the Sirdar, and stated that, on\nreaching Fashoda, he had been fired on by a\nforce of natives, under white officers, and, after\nlosing a number of men, had been compelled to\nbeat a retreat.\nOn receipt of the above information, the Sirdar\n-seeing possible diplomatic difficulties looming\nahead-ordered all the special correspondents to\nreturn at once to Cairo. At 6 A.M. on the morning,\nof the 10th he steamed full speed to Fashoda,\ntaking with him a company of the Cameron High-\n"

Andrew Murray,\nand the 10th, 11th, and 13th Soudanese battalions.\nThese troops were conveyed in the gunboats\nSultan (Keppel), Fatteh, and Nazir; the Sirdar,\nwith Colonel Wingate and Slatin Pasha, going on\nthe Dal (post-boat). The party was joined, on\nthe 17th, by the Abu Klea.\nOn Sunday, the 18th, the Dervish steamer Safia\nwas captured. On arriving at Fashoda (21st), the\ninformation received by the Sirdar proved to be\ncorrect, and it was found that Major Marchand,\nwith a small armed force of eight officers and\n120 Senegalese soldiers, were in occupation of\nthe place, where they had arrived on the tenth\nof July and had hoisted the French flag. The\nMajor came on board the Dal, and had a private\ninterview, lasting about half an hour, with the\nSirdar; in which the latter pointed out to him that\nhe was occupying Egyptian territory, and requested\nhim to haul down his flag and to withdraw. This\nMajor Marchand courteously but firmly refused to\ndo, until so ordered by the French Government ;\nwhereupon the Sirdar landed his troops, posted\nthem behind the French encampment, and hoisted\nthe British and Egyptian flags with all due cere-\nmony. This done, he left the 11th Soudanese,\nunder Major Jackson (Gordon Highlanders, Egyp-\ntian Army), to hold the place, and proceeded south\nwith the rest of the little force to Sobat, where he\narrived on the 22nd, and established a second post\n-three companies of the 13th Soudanese being\n"

The return journey was commenced\non the 23rd, Fashoda being reached the same day.\nHere the Sultan and Nazir were left behind, and\nthe Sirdar went on with the Camerons and 10th\nBattalion to Omdurman, which was reached on the\n24th of September. The Sirdar at once cabled to\nthe Foreign Office the result of his mission. The\ncase was now outside the scope of his duties or\npowers, and had become a matter which diplomacy\nalone could deal with.\nThe same day as the Sirdar's return to Omdurman,\n(Sept. 24th) Major-General Sir Francis Grenfell,\ncommanding the British troops in Egypt, arrived\nthere from Cairo ; and on Monday he reviewed\nthe whole of the Egyptian force, outside the town.\nMeanwhile, during the Sirdar's journey up the\nWhite Nile, Major-General Hunter had proceeded\nup the Blue Nile with a small force, and, meeting\nwith hardly any opposition, had effectually subdued\nand pacified that region. Captain Murray's\ncompany of Camerons went on to Cairo, where the\nSirdar himself arrived on the 6th of October.\nThe final act for the clearance of the Soudan\nfrom the Dervish was the occupation of Gedaref\nby Colonel Parsons, Commandant at Kassala. As\nsoon as Omdurman had fallen, news was brought\nto the Sirdar that a band of Dervishes were pillaging\nvillages along the banks of the Nile, whereupon a\ngunboat was immediately sent up the river to find\nthem. A short engagement ensued, in which the\nenemy lost 1,000 killed and wounded, and the\n"

The place was surrounded by a wall,\nand defended by a mud fort; and the Dervish\ngarrison, who numbered about 3,000 men, were\narmed chiefly with rifles captured by the Abyssinians\nfrom the Italians at Adowa. After a fierce fight,\nwhich lasted three hours, the place was captured and\nthe enemy were utterly routed. On the Egyptian side\nthe casualties were :- 16th Battalion : 3 officers (na-\ntive) wounded; 20 men killed, and 30 wounded;\nArab \"Irregulars,\" Camel Corps, &c. : I officer\n(native) wounded; 17 men killed, and 23 wounded.\nSo that the total number of casualties on our side\nwas under a hundred, whilst the enemy were esti-\nmated to have lost 700. On the 28th of September\na strong force of Dervishes, under Ahmed Fedl,\nmade a desperate effort to regain possession of\nGedaref, but were repulsed by Colonel Parsons's\ntroops, with heavy loss; many of the Arabs\nsurrendered, and the remainder dispersed.\nThis was the last stand made by the Dervishes, and,\nafter fourteen years of anarchy and bloodshed, peace\nreigned once more throughout the Egyptian Soudan.\n*\n*\n*\n*\nIn concluding the story of the re-conquest of the\n1 The telegraph from Suakin-which had been constructed by\nCorporal Lewis, R.E., under the superintendence of Lieutenant\nManifold, R.E.- reached Kassala on the 24th of September.\n"
"CHAP. IX\n287\nKHARTOUM-AND AFTER\nSoudan, we may call attention to some of the salient\npoints of the three years' campaign which mark it\nout as unique in history. In the first place, the\nstrategy throughout was totally different to that\nadopted in expeditions of a like nature. It is usual,\nwhen once the invading force has started, to push it\nforward with the least possible delay, until the goal\nhas been reached; in these expeditions, however,\nall forward movement was entirely subordinate to\ntwo important considerations, namely, the construc-\ntion of the railway and the rise of the Nile. Until\nthe railway was completed to a given point, and\nstores had been accumulated at the front, no attempt\nwas made to push on further.\nIn the Dongola Expedition, Akasheh was seized\nat the outset, and then there was a long pause, to\nallow time for the railway to be pushed forward.\nThen came the sudden swoop on Ferket, followed\nby another stationary period, whilst the stern-\nwheelers were being hauled through the Second\nCataract, the sections of the new gunboats were\nbeing put together at Kosheh, and vast quantities\nof commissariat stores were being conveyed by rail\nto the front. No sooner were these preparations\ncompleted, than the Sirdar, with lightning rapidity,\nmade another swoop on the Dervishes, routed them\nat Hafir, and struck the final blow at Dongola.\nThe difficulties which the Sirdar had to surmount\nin the campaign of 1896, were as great as they\nwere unforeseen. The outbreak of cholera, the\nexceptionally late rise of the Nile, the prolonged\n"
"288\nPART IV\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nspell of southerly winds (which delayed the store-\nladen gyassas), the phenomenal storms (which de-\nstroyed the railway), the untimely explosion on the\nZafir, the running aground of the El Teb, these\nare only a few of the many instances that might be\ncited to prove how the Sirdar was hampered\nfrom beginning to end by natural, rather than by\nstrategical obstacles.\nThe campaign of 1897 presented much the same\ndifficulties as that of the previous year, and the\nlessons to be gathered from it are in matters of\ncommissariat and transport, rather than strategy.\nThe same policy was pursued by the Sirdar. The\nrailway was pushed forward across the desert as\nnear to Abu Hamed as was compatible with safety,\nand then a sudden and brilliant move was made by\nGeneral Hunter upon this point, from Merawi;\nafter which the railway was continued as far as the\nriver Atbara.\nThe Nile Expedition of 1898 was marked by two\nstriking features. One was the extraordinary man-\nner in which the Khalifa, and his subordinate\nMahmud, played into the Sirdar's hands; the other\nwas the admirable administration of the Anglo-\nEgyptian force. The advance of Mahmud from\nMetemmeh to the Atbara, was as unexpected as\nit was fortunate, for it was never for a moment\nanticipated that he would leave his admirable\nstrategical position on the Nile, and advance to do\nbattle with the Sirdar. It was thought, rather,\nthat he would await the arrival of the invading\n"
"CHAP. IX\n289\nKHARTOUM-AND AFTER\nforce in some well-fortified position commanding\nthe passage of the river, when the rise of the Nile\nshould render another advance expedient on the\npart of the Sirdar's force. The delay in Mahmud's\nadvance afforded the Sirdar time to obtain the\nassistance of the British brigade; and, with his\nforce thus strengthened, he was enabled to ad-\nvance, with admirable promptitude, and annihilate\nMahmud's army. The total rout of the latter\nat the battle of the Atbara cleared the way for\nthe final advance, by accounting effectively for\nthe only large Dervish force outside the walls of\nOmdurman.\nA noticeable feature of the final advance was the\nprecision and foresight with which it was carried\nout, without a single hitch. Comparisons, we know,\nare odious; but the manner in which the transport\nand commissariat arrangements of this force-the\nlargest ever sent into the Soudan under civilised\nconditions-were carried out, will bear favourable\ncomparison with any campaign, not only British, of\nmodern times.\nThe flotilla of gunboats was indispensable\nto the successful issue of the campaign; and,\nbut for the bombardment of Omdurman-which\nundoubtedly determined the Khalifa to leave the\ncity and fight in the open-the Sirdar might\nhave found the capture of Omdurman a far more\nhazardous and formidable undertaking than it\nproved to be.\nU\n"
"290\nPART IV\nTHE EGYPTIAN SOUDAN\nWe have not yet alluded to what was perhaps\nthe greatest difficulty in the Sirdar's path, namely,\nthe lack of funds. From beginning to end the\nstrictest economy had to be observed; and never,\nin modern times, has so much country been con-\nquered at such little expense. The actual cost of\nthe Dongola Expedition was £733,000, but this\nsum included £185,000 for the extension of the\nrailway and telegraph from Wady Halfa to Sarras,\nand the purchase of the gunboats. Nearly 600\nmiles of railway were constructed for this sum\nunder the most trying conditions. The record for\nmilitary railway construction (hitherto held by the\nRussians over their Trans-Siberian railway) was\nbeaten by the Sirdar's railway staff; although the\nline lay through a waterless desert necessitating\n2,500 workmen being provided with their daily\nfood and drink. The total length of railway con-\nstructed during the three years (1896-1898) was\n500 miles at a cost of one million pounds; and the\ntotal cost of the military operations during that\nperiod came to £2,600,000.\nNor was a record attained only in the matter of\nexpenditure; never has so much country been\nconquered with so little loss of life. Approximately\nthe casualties of the Anglo-Egyptian Forces (1896-\n1898) numbered 2,300; of whom 1,200 (400 British)\nwere killed or died from sickness; whilst the\nnumber of Dervishes killed and wounded during\nthat period cannot have been less than 36,000.\n"
"CHAP. IX\n291\nKHARTOUM-AND AFTER\nFrom first to last the three years' campaign was\na complete success; was a source of gratification to\nthose who took part in it; and reflected the highest\ncredit upon those who were responsible for planning\nit out and bringing it to its successful issue.\nThe masterly grasp of detail and faculty of\norganisation possessed by the Sirdar, Sir Herbert\nKitchener, showed itself clearly from the day he\ntook command of the Nile Expeditionary Force, in\n1896, to the day he finally destroyed the Khalifa's\narmy. With machine-like precision he carried out\nhis plans; never in a hurry, but never wasting\na moment. Slow and cautious to prepare, and\nneglecting nothing that might assist his purpose,\nhe was swift and sure to strike. The clash of battle\nis appreciated by every soldier more than the\ndrudgery of railway construction and the transport\nof stores; but the Sirdar showed himself a man of\niron, endowed with extreme patience. He never\ngave battle until absolutely certain of victory;\nensured the success, beforehand, of whatever he\nattempted; and no general was ever better trusted\nby his troops than was \"Gordon's Avenger.\"\nThe recapture of the Soudan will be followed\nby the occupation of those Equatorial provinces,\nwhich, until the rising of the Mahdi were held\nby the Egyptian Government, and this will bring\ninto possibility the great Imperial aspiration of\nopening up the vast area of Central Africa.
